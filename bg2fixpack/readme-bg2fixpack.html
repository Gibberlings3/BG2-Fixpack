      <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> compilation
        of fixes for Baldur's Gate II. With the disappearance of Kevin Dorner and
        the cessation of activity of the Baldurdash fixpack for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
        several modders began working on a new <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> fixpack
        to address the numerous bugs that have been identified since Baldurdash.
        This collaborative effort, including the work of modders from several different
        modding communities and assistance from <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> lead
        writer David Gaider, has resulted in a fixpack that currently includes all
        of the fixes addressed by Baldurdash (including the Game Text Update) and
        several hundred new bugfixes. The project is ongoing, and we're working through
        a substantial list of bugs culled from various sites, the old Baldurdash
        forums, and our own research. </p>
      <p>Though the project has long since left beta status, there remains a need to introduce
        and test new fixes. To facilitate these new fixes without compromising the
        stability of the project, a component entitled <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong> is
        available. This component includes fixes intended for the Core Fixes component
        and tested in a limited fashion, but have not yet been tested 'in the wild'
        or with other mods. <strong>As such, this component is considered to be of
        a BETA status.</strong> As fixes in this component get tested and validated
        in the wild, they will move into the Core Fixes. </p>
      <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack strives for complete transparency  in its fixes. As such, <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">complete documentation</a> is available of the fixes on the project pages, visual fixes are noted in the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?app=gallery&amp;album=26"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack Gallery</a>, and  all discussions leading up to fixes are in the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=74">Fixpack forums</a>. There are no  private workrooms. </p>

      <p>The Fixpack is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II with or without the
        Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. <strong>In terms of installation order, the
        Fixpack should be installed after the official patches, but before other
        mods. Do not install the Fixpack alongside other fixpacks such as Baldurdash. </strong>There
        is a <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=3693">compatibility
        and redundancy thread</a> in the Fixpack forums for the most recent information; these are the known incompatibilities and redundancies as of v11:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Edition - </strong>The Fixpack developers work with the Enhanced Editions to include the bugfixes deirectly into the Enhanced Editions. As such, the main components (Core Fixes, Game Text Update, BETA Core Fixes) are unavailable for install and will be skipped automatically. Some of the Optional But Cool components are available. </li>
        <li><strong>Baldurdash or any other previous fixpack</strong> - 
          We used the bug lists from previous efforts to fix bugs as a starting point.
          If the bugs aren't already fixed by the Fixpack they will be in future
          versions. Installing Baldurdash alongside Fixpack will result in a lot
          of issues. </li>
        <li><strong>Tutu</strong> - 
          The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack is not built for installation on Tutu games. Macready's Easytutu has incorporated several relevant fixes from Fixpack; for traditional Tutu games there will likely be installation errors that prevent 
          installation of the Fixpack.</li>
        <li> <strong>D0Tweak</strong> - 
          The 'Corrected Demon Animations' component is included in the core fixes.
          'Corrected Summoned Demon Behavior' and 'Ghrey's Holy Symbol Fix' are included
          as Optional But Cool components.</li>
        <li> <strong>Ease of Use</strong> - 
          Ease of Use is deprecated by the more modern (and actively supported) <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>. If you insist, however, note that the Edwina Portrait component
          from Ease of Use will overwrite our Edwin/Edwina 'gliding animation' fixes.
          This is not the case with the same component from Tweaks Anthology. </li>
        <li><strong>LuvNalia</strong> - 
          Sir Billy Bob's repackaged Nalia romance will report errors when trying to
          patch ar2904.bcs. These are non-fatal errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Oversight</strong> - 
          The 'Alignment Corrections' component was used as a basis for the alignment
          changes in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack, making them semi-redundant. 'Improved Continuity'
          is included except for the Saemon Havarian bits; it should be safe to install
          if you want to get the extra Saemon material.</li>
        <li> <strong>Quest Pack</strong> - 
          The Revised Hell Trials component will generate warnings if the <acronym title="Optional But Cool">OBC</acronym> Additional
          Script Fixes component from Fixpack is installed. A <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=8676">workaround</a> is
          available.</li>
        <li><strong>The Bigg Tweak Pack</strong>- 
          The Unlimited Limited Wish and Wish component is included in the core fixes. </li>

      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The BG2 Fixpack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-bg2fixpack.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>bg2fixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-bg2fixpack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-bg2fixpack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The BG2 Fixpack for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-bg2fixpack</strong>, <strong>setup-bg2fixpack.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>bg2fixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-bg2fixpack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-bg2fixpack.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The BG2 Fixpack for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall bg2fixpack in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-bg2fixpack --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

      <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack is basically
        four items: core fixes, a game text update, beta core fixes,
        and several optional but cool fixes. Optional But Cool is broken down further
        into individual components. </p>
      <p><strong><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack (Core Fixes) </strong><br />
        This component includes all fixes deemed to be core by the Fixpack team.
        While some bugs are clearly bugs, the team also has a review process for
        'gray area' bugs to insure that fixes do not contradict developer intent.
        The result is a 'core fixes' component which aims to address true bugs
        only and in a manner consistent with BioWare's original goals. When we
        encounter something we happen to think is a bug (or just strange behavior)
        but appears to be intentional, we generally fix those as an Optional But
        Cool component. <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/docs_core.php">Complete
        documentation</a> is available on the <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> web site. Additionally, the complete <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=74">Fixpack
        forums</a> are open, so if you want to see the reasoning behind a bugfix
        (or tell us we've got it all wrong), please join us on the forums and provide
        feedback. If you find a bug that is not fixed and is not in our <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=92">Pending
        Fixes</a> forum, please report it. </p>
      <p><strong>Game Text Update </strong><br />
        <em>English Only </em><br />
        This component, based upon the Baldurdash Game Text Update, seeks to
        address miscellaneous errors in the text. Typos, grammatical errors,
        item description inconsistencies, etc. are addressed by this component.
        It should be noted that incorrect text that is actually a bug is
        addressed by Core Fixes. The Game Text Update can&nbsp;be installed in
        two ways. The first (and recommended) option will install &quot;<acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> Light&quot;
        (by Wisp), a fairly minimalistic dialogue update which contains only
        the most relevant typographical corrections. The second option will
        install &quot;<acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> Classic&quot; (from Baldurdash, by Kevin Dorner), an in-depth
        dialogue revision, parts of which may be considered arbitrary by
        purists. </p>
      <p class="deprecated"><strong>Super Happy Fun Lucky Modder Pack (DEPRECATED)</strong><br />
        This component has been discontinued due to lack of interest. </p>
      <p><strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong><br />
        Though the Fixpack has long since left beta, new fixes still need to be added. This
        component includes fixes intended for the Core Fixes component and tested
        in a limited fashion, but have not yet been tested 'in the wild' or with
        other mods. <strong>As such, this component is considered to be of a BETA
        status.</strong> As fixes in this component get tested and validated in
        the wild, they will move into the Core Fixes. These fixes are <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/docs_core.php">shown in red on the documentation page</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Party Gets <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> for
        Sending Keldorn to Reconcile With Maria</strong><br />
        In Keldorn's personal quest, if you go with Keldorn when he reconciles with
        Maria the party receives <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym>.
        However, if you send him alone to reconcile you do not--this component gives
        you <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> for sending him alone
        to reconcile. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Improved Spell Animations</strong><br />
        This component alters the animations of several spells, including Maze, by
        addressing subtle errors in their animation cycles. </p>
      <p class="deprecated"><strong>Optional But Cool: Cromwell's Forging Actually Takes a Day (DEPRECATED)</strong><br />
        This component has been moved to the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a> to facilitate more options. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Mixed-Use Dagger Fixes</strong><br />
        Daggers that can be used in melee and thrown are an irresolvable bug: when
        thrown, daggers should get an extra attack per round, but there's no way
        to apply this bonus without also granting it when he dagger is being used
        in melee. This component grants the extra attack but at the expense of
        removing melee abilities. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Ghreyfain's Holy Symbol Fixes</strong><br />
        Basically, it makes the granting of Holy Symbols in the game a bit more logical.
        Aerie gets the symbol of Baervan, Viconia gets the symbol of Shar, and
        Anomen gains the symbol of Helm even when lawful good (he used to get Lathander's).</p>
      <p class="deprecated"><strong>Optional But Cool: Additional Hero Quests in Trademeet Wait Until
        Hero is Officially Named (DEPRECATED)</strong><br />
        This was confirmed by BioWare as an actual bug and has been moved into the core fixes. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Giants Receive Penalties When Attacking Halflings,
        Dwarves, and Gnomes</strong><br />
        This component gives giants their <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> penalty
        when trying to attack undersized (halflings, dwarves, gnomes) foes. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Remove Dual-Classing Restriction from Archers
        and Stalkers</strong><br />
        In Throne of Bhaal, archers and stalkers can't dual-class to clerics as
        normal rangers and beastmasters can; for consistency Core Fixes adds this
        restriction to <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>-only games as
        well. This component will remove the restriction.</p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Remove Second Attribute Bonus for Evil Path in
        Wrath Hell Trial</strong><br />
        If the protagonist selects the 'evil' option when speaking to Sarevok in
        the Hell Trials, the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> gets rewarded twice with attribute bonuses. There
        are several factors that suggest one of the bonuses is leftover junk in the
        script, but there's not enough evidence of developer intent to include it
        in the Core Fixes. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Corrected Summoned Demon Behavior</strong><br />
        This component alters the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of
        summoned demons, causing them to behave less predictably, but at the same
        time, more realistically (i.e. Baatezu will attack Tanar'ri). </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Additional Script Fixes</strong><br />
        There are several additional scripting errors which can't be fixed by the
        core fixes. While clearly bugs, what was intended by the developers is
        more towards speculation and, as such, these fixes have been moved into
        their own component. Most of the bugs are missing checks in spellcaster
        scripts for memorized spells (or casting spells). A more detailed account
        of the changes can be found in the full <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/docs_core.php">Optional
        But Cool documentation</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Bard Song Fixes<br />
        </strong>The manual describes bard's Battlesong as granting &quot;morale and luck
        improvement for the party.&quot; And then goes on to describe a luck <i>bonus</i> for
        the party as though it were a luck <i>penalty</i> for opponents. And then
        in-game battlesong grants only immunity to fear (without preventing the additional
        effects that can accompany fear) with no morale or luck effects at all. Our
        best educated guess at developer intent adds a +1 luck bonus to battlesong,
        which improves to +2 at 15th level and improves again to +3 at 20th level.
        Blade's version of battlesong in this component still does not improve with
        levels (as the class disadvantage states) and Skald and Jester songs (which
        already vaguely match their descriptions and work) are untouched.</p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Wizard Slayers Cause Miscast Magic on Ranged
        Attacks<br />
        </strong>The original kit description of the Wizard Slayer states as a kit
        advantage: &quot;For each successful hit on an opponent, 10% cumulative spell
        failure penalty is applied&quot;. However, it was only applying this effect
        on melee hits. The Core Fixes do not change this and the Game Text Update
        clarifies the kit description to specify melee-only. This component allows
        players to extend the ability to both melee and ranged attacks and updates
        the kit description. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Additional Alignment Fixes <br />
        </strong>As part of the Core Fixes, the Fixpack addresses many creatures
        who either lack alignment, have conflicting alignments between their creature
        files, or have an alignment completely at odds with their behavior. These
        changes underwent a great deal of scrutiny in an organized review, and it
        was decided that some of them should be moved into an optional component
        as there was no general consensus for the new alignments of these specific
        creatures. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Change Free Action to Protect Against Stun</strong> <br />
        BioWare was very inconsistent about whether free action should protect against
        stun or not. The spell did not protect against it, but most items that
        grant free action did. However, per David Gaider, free action is not supposed
        to protect against stun. For players who think this overpowers stun (particularly
        mind flayer psionics) this component will extend free action to protect
        against stun. </p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Paws from Shapeshifting Can
        Not Be Dispelled</strong><br />
        <em>Windows-only, requires TobEx</em><br />
        <!--
	Dispel magic effects always dispel magically created weapons, such as energy
      blades, black baldes of disaster, or the paws of shapeshifter druids. In
      the last case the form is not dispellable, so it leaves the shapeshifter
      in werewolf form but able to use normal weapons. This component makes these
      items not subject to a dispel magic. This should be a core fix, but because
      it causes the animation cycles to constantly reset which, though purely
  cosmetic, can be distracting and unwanted. 
  --> 
        Dispel magic will no longer remove the paws of shapeshifted creatures.</p>
      <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Remove Thieving Start Bonuses from Bard and Ranger Skills</strong> <br />
        All thieving skills use one lookup table to determine their racial bonuses for their abilities. However, the table is actually a combination of racial bonuses and initial thieving abilities. This component seeks to remove the initial thief bonuses from non-thief classes. Specifically, bards will no longer receive a 15% bonus to their pickpocket skills, and rangers will not receive the 7% bonus to stealth.</p>

      <p>The Fixpack would not be possible without the hard work of many, many people.
        There's no way to try and acknowledge this many people without missing someone,
        so if you've been left off please let us know so you can be properly acknowledged. </p>

      <p>In addition, there are a couple of folks we would like to single out for
        acknowledgement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>David Gaider:</strong> Officially credited as a member of the
          'core design team' for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
          David's probably better described as the head writer. David was kind enough
          to answer questions regarding developer intent with respect to several
          fixes. </li>
        <li><strong>devSin:</strong> An excellent right-hand man, whose intimate
          knowledge of arcane engine details helped us identify and solve a huge
          number of bugs. </li>
        <li><strong>Nythrun:</strong> An angel who's come out of nowhere to help
          with just about everything. </li>
        <li><strong>DavidW, </strong><strong>Wisp &amp; aVENGER:</strong> These three stepped in after much of the original team had moved on, and led the project through four additional releases</li>
        <li><strong>Wes Weimer, the bigg, and Wisp:</strong> Such an effort wouldn't even
          be possible without a tool like <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
          In particular, the new patching abilities of the last 20-30 versions have
          made a huge number of really nifty things possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Kish and SimDing0:</strong> Often the two counterpoints to determining
          what needed to be fixed and how, their input was invaluable. </li>
        <li><strong>Kevin Dorner:</strong> We tried to recruit Kevin for the project
          but never got a response. Nonetheless, the bug list (both fixed and pending)
          from Baldurdash was a huge aid when we developed our own fixes.</li>
        <li><strong>igi and the <acronym title="Infinity Engine Structures Description Project">IESDP</acronym> contributors:</strong> The <acronym title="Infinity Engine Structures Description Project">IESDP</acronym> was
          invaluable for a project of this scope. igi, as the maintainer, and the
          various <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/credits.htm"><acronym title="Infinity Engine Structures Description Project">IESDP</acronym> contributors</a> also
          deserve credit. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thanks as well to yarpen for the Polish translation, Leonardo Watson for
        the German translation, Immortality and Clan DLAN (with revisions from Ghildrean)
        for the Spanish translation, Anomaly for the French translation, web2air
        for the Korean translation,  Andrea C. for the Italian translation, and good0593 for the Chinese translations.</p>
      <p>Versions 7-8 of the Fixpack were coded by DavidW, in consultation
        with devSin and using code and observations by Nythrun, aVENGER,
        Taimon, Wisp, ScuD, Icendoan and Mike1072. Version 9 was coded by
        aVENGER, in consultation with devSin, using code and observations by
        Nythrun,&nbsp;Wisp and Jason Compton. Version 10 is primarily an aVENGER-Wisp-CamDawg project, with the usual assistance from the folks on the Fixpack forums.</p>
      <p>Versions 11 and higher owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Enhanced Editions produced by Beamdog. The playtesting and QA teams uncovered scores of bugs still unfixed in the original games, which Fixpack now addresses. Several bugs in Fixpack itself were also identified and fixed. </p>

                <li>Various replies to Gereth went to the wrong place</li>
                <li>The inspector was checking for the wrong item in the Bridge murders--it's an unused branch of dialogue but fixed anyway</li>
                <li>The farmers affected by the broken dike in the fighter stronghold quests would never give their 'happiest' response due to an error</li>

            <li>Items and spells that relied on percentile rolls for effects were almost universally incorrect by 1%. For example, Celestial Fury is supposed to add 20 points of damage on 5% of hits, but was adding damage on 6% of hits; the various Monster Summoning spells were supposed to summon two creatures 40% of the time but it only happened on 39% of castings. This affected approximately 100 items and spells in the game.</li>

            <li>Heavy Crossbow of Searing was only doing fire damage on half of its hits instead of all of them</li>
            <li>Several spells had their casting animations corrected to match their schools</li>
            <li>Yet more spell school fixes</li>
            <li>Sounds for various spells were either incorrect or playing on the wrong target</li>
            <li>Stoneskin, when cast at level 7, was providing too many skins</li>
            <li>The 'Great Druid' title change will now be slightly less destructive to the record sheets of fighter-druids</li>
            <li>Grease could cause battle music to loop, as it was flagged hostile</li>
            <li>Visual effects  for the Cacofiend wild surge only played half the time</li>

            <li>Working for Bodhi didn't clear all of Gaelan Bayle's journal entries</li>
            <li>Prophets for the Unseeing Eye were failing to spawn in the Bridge and Promenade districts due to some bad variable scopes</li>
            <li>The Ruby Pendant is supposed to be able to Charm once per day</li>
            <li>Frennedan, the doppleganger in the opening dungeon, couldn't actually kill you since he had no actual weapon</li>
            <li>Paralytic Bolts had incorrect durations and saving throw type on their stun effect</li>
            <li>Casting Improved Invisibility or Glitterdust via scroll caused redundant projectiles; this is fixed though it was generally harmless</li>
            <li>The ranger Charm Animal ability now uses its unique icon</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Optional But Cool</strong> changes
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cromwell's Forging Actually Takes a Day</strong> is now deprecated; it's been moved to <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a> to provide more options and to make it available to BGIIEE players</li>
            <li>The regular bard song in <strong>Bard Song Fixes</strong> now retains the original range of the unpatched bard song</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Beta 2 - June 19, 2017 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed duplicate fix for adding a name to Psionic Blast (was in core and beta core, now just core)</li>
        <li>SoA-only fix to provide Black Blade of Disaster with Grandmastery was patching in the wrong opcode</li>
        <li>Shield of the Lost string fix</li>
        <li>Games with TobEx no longer choke on spcl741d.spl</li>
        <li>One more inventory fix; this one for ar18prie who was dual-wielding... poorly</li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Beta 1 - June 4, 2017 </strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>General Changes
    <ul>
      <li>Massive recode. The Fixpack was essentially   rewritten from the ground up, with an emphasis on code that is easier to   maintain, easier for players to understand and edit, and with an   emphasis on forcing common patches into macros and arrays for easier   handling.</li>
      <li>All of the Beta Core fixes (from the never-officially-released   v10.01) were moved into the core fixes. BWS has been using this version   unofficially for years (I believe they designated it as v11 Alpha 1), so   these fixes have seen field testing. Unfortunately, the official   documentation of these was never uploaded, so they will be included in   the docs writeup.</li>
      <li>Fixpack is now a lot more flexible for language-specific fixes; e.g.   string fixes and sound files fixes can now be language-specific</li>
      <li>Fixpack no longer uses dummy files for third-party detection. Use MOD_IN_INSTALLED instead.</li>
      <li>GTU Light/GTU Classic continue to get minor updates and improvements as they get reported.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes to Core Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Haer'Dalis had no pickpocketing skill, which Fixpack   corrected (courtesy of an old Baldurdash fix). However, Fixpack also   implements a fix to give blades their proper one-half penalty to   pickpockets, rendering the previous fix incorrect.</li>
      <li>Ice Trolls were switched to generic troll soundsets; Fixpack now   imports their soundset from Icewind Dale. Similarly, one of Ilyich's   scripted sounds is now imported from BG (one sound from Montaron's   soundset) instead of removing the script reference to it.</li>
      <li>The fix for SoA characters having no interjections in Watcher's Keep   was redone. The previous code could result in NO VALID LINKS errors,   e.g. if you had Aerie speak to Yakman, promise to heal him, and then   speak to him again.</li>
      <li>Load hints were being fixed in such a way as to leave duplicate load hints in the table.</li>
      <li>Thanks to previous fixes, Otiluke's Resilient Sphere works. As a   result, though, it was subject to saves and resistance if it was   self-cast. It will now bypass saves and protections when self-cast, and   have to penetrate same when cast at enemies.</li>
      <li>At various points, Fixpack tries to copy-and-patch files which don't need changing and/or are already correct:
        <ul>
          <li>forcef.bcs, keyscrip.bcs, npc.bcs, and ppshad01-ppchad06.bcs are dropped from the Miscellaneous Script Resource Reference Fixes</li>
          <li>One monk in Amketheran (ammonk03.cre) was missing her fist, which   Fixpack restored. This change is being dropped, as the engine   automatically assigns monk fists to creatures on load, so the change was   unnecessary.</li>
          <li>telicesa.cre does not need to be patched as part of the summoned creatures fix</li>
          <li>Kiel's Helmet (helm14.itm) does not need to be patched under the Item Effects Failing Due to Bad Timing Modes fix</li>
          <li>Staff of Air (staf15) no longer patched as part of Elven Sleep/Charm Resistance</li>
          <li>Black and Shadow Dragon Breath (spin691.spl, spin893.spl) removed   from Spells Lacking Sounds and Animations as the resources were fine</li>
          <li>The entire Anti-Magic Ray Not Destroying All Magically Created   Weapons is dropped outright, as dispel magic effects already nuke these   resources</li>
          <li>sp313l20.eff no longer created for Holy Smite fixes, as it's not needed</li>
          <li>Vampire regeneration (vampreg, vamreg2, vampreg3) items were being   patched to add 100% poison damage immunity, but they already have it</li>
          <li>Several scrolls already had 0 power in their casting opcodes, making   their patch unnecessary (scrl1o.itm, scrl1u.itm, scrl2f.itm,   scrl5i.itm, scrl70.itm, scrl7i.itm, scrl8p.itm, scrl94.itm)</li>
          <li>In addition, the contagion scroll already had the correct target (scrla8.itm)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Ellisime's clone got her combat AI fixed to cast spells, but could now get stuck in a loop of casting Mirror Image</li>
      <li>The fix to keep Saerk's Estate in the Bridge district inaccessible was not getting all of the doors</li>
      <li>The scripts fix to clear out the rubble-gawkers in Waukeen's Promenade is now more reliable</li>
      <li>The better fix to uncharm/dispel Glaicus at the de'Arnise Keep from Beta Core fixes has been mainlined</li>
      <li>The fix to keep Baron Ployer from killing Jaheira in a cutscene is now simpler and more reliable</li>
      <li>The fix to prevent multiple copies of unique items from the City of Caverns has been expanded to cover a few more scenarios.</li>
      <li>The fix to prevent enemy celestials from healing the party has been   expanded to cover other beneficial spell casting such as Cure Disease or   Remove Fear</li>
      <li>The Tree of Life has now been flagged as an outdoor area</li>
      <li>Entering and leaving Coran's cabin now requires the party in both directions</li>
      <li>Spore Colonies were supposed to be set as gender: neither, but   Fixpack was copying one spore colony twice and missing the second   creature file</li>
      <li>As part of creature inventory fixes, Imoen was getting her healing   potions restored. Instead of three individual potions, they now come as a   single stack of three.</li>
      <li>Summoned creatures had a handful of items restored to their   inventories and then made undroppable; Fixpack now just deletes these   items</li>
      <li>Abazigal's head was protected from pickpocketing in his dragon form;   similar protection is added to his human form. In addition, the giant   troll's head in Spellhold is no longer pickpocketable</li>
      <li>Two drow in Sendai's enclave had typos in their inventories fixed,   dwbolt01 (drow bolts) for the bad reference bwbolt01. However, since   they were in outdoor areas (and hence sunlight) Fixpack now replaces   these bad references with Bolts of Lightning instead.</li>
      <li>The SoA and ToB wish genies were inconsistent and Fixpack simply   cloned the ToB genie to replace the buggy SoA genie. However, for   SoA-only games where this is not done, the SoA wish genie needed   different patches to address some errors.</li>
      <li>Troll Fixes has expanded to include the troll cook in the de'Arnise   Keep, as she lost her name and vocation during her dead/revive cycles.</li>
      <li>The familiar fixes, specifically to the SoA cat, were removing her movement rate bonus.</li>
      <li>Fixes were made which really won't affect the player:
        <ul>
          <li>Several familiars had Blur as a known spell even   though it was not one of their castable spells; this is removed. Other   familiars which should actually know Blur had its level set incorrectly</li>
          <li>One of the E3 demo creatures (e32.cre) gets better inventory fixes</li>
          <li>Three effs being patched as part of a timing cleanup failed due to a bad SOURCE_SIZE check</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It was confirmed by the devs that Jaheira knowing the   class-restricted Zone of Sweet Air and Viconia knowing the   alignment-restricted Holy Smite are intentional. Fixpack no longer   removes these spells from their spellbooks.</li>
      <li>The fix for the inconsistent ice mephit coloring missed one area</li>
      <li>Bone Fiend's attack lacked a magical flag</li>
      <li>Spectral Brand +5 was being patched to a weapon speed of one to   match its description; however in this case the item was correct and its   weapon speed is now set to zero</li>
      <li>Most of the weapon speed and weight fixes found by Ardanis (<a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=21871&amp;p=197651" title="">old link</a>, but fairly accurate) have been confirmed and included</li>
      <li>A couple of item weights have been corrected from previous versions,   notably throwing daggers going back to zero weight and Fortress Shield   being 10 lbs</li>
      <li>More usability fixes, mostly from the discussion <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=25083" title="">over here</a> (note that the changes here are in comparison to Fixpack v10):
        <ul>
          <li>Drow scimitars are now usable by thieves and mage-thieves</li>
          <li>Ashen Scales and Shield of the Lost are now available to druids.   Description for Ashen Scales is updated, too, but the shield was missed   in beta 1.</li>
          <li>Rings of Wizardry and the Silver Sword are disallowed from monks</li>
          <li>Ashen Scales, Red Dragon Scale, Blue Dragon Plate forbidden from avengers</li>
          <li>Three variants of the Flail of Ages +1, drow halberds, drow lance,   drow long swords, and the Silver Sword are forbidden from beastmasters</li>
          <li>White Dragon Scale is usable by stalkers</li>
          <li>Ankheg Plate, Red Dragon Scale, and Blue Dragon Plate forbidden from archers</li>
          <li>Amulet of the Seldarine, Amulet of the Master Harper, and Heartwood Ring are forbidden from wizard slayers</li>
          <li>Storm Ring and Dawn Ring now usable by wizard slayers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Shield Amulets (Shield) and Ring of Earth Control (Flesh to Stone) now just cast their underlying spells directly</li>
      <li>The patches to address bad APR stacking when Melf's Minute Meteors,   Boon of Lathander and Offensive Spin combine is now skipped is TobEx is   installed, as TobEx fixes this at an engine level</li>
      <li>Spells from Items now covers the tutorial Wand of the Heavens</li>
      <li>Arbane's Sword should protect against the spinny head animations used for hold, but these protections were being removed</li>
      <li>Spell schools could still interfere with the HP gain effects of Larloch's Minor Drain and Vampiric Touch</li>
      <li>Hardiness via wish or via HLA no longer stack with one another (they already couldn't stack with themselves)</li>
      <li>Iron Skins is back to its instant casting speed</li>
      <li>Blindness, Infravision, and Spook were having their ranges corrected to the wrong value--visual range is 30', not 60'</li>
      <li>The Detect Evil part of Moon Dog Sight now respects MR</li>
      <li>The spell to paralyze a party member as part of the hell selfish trial should stand up better to dispel magic</li>
      <li>Maze via psionics now has the same visuals as mage via the arcane spell</li>
      <li>Spell Shield duration was still incorrect when cast at level 10 or below</li>
      <li>Bigby's Crushing Hand needed even more fixes, as its sounds were playing at the wrong time</li>
      <li>Bolt of Glory is now changed to do magic damage to everyone instead of missile, as undead are very resistant to missile damage</li>
      <li>The fix to the BM2 music file (used as battle music in a handful of areas) was pointing to a music track that didn't exist</li>
      <li>Changes to the immunity batches:
        <ul>
          <li>The charm protection as part of the Elven   Sleep/Charm immunity could still show the string 'dominated' even if the   charm was resisted</li>
          <li>Similarly, the sleep part of Elven Sleep/Charm immunity provided no   resistance to power word: sleep effects, but did block two unrelated   animations</li>
          <li>Free action no longer blocks defensive spin explicitly, as its no longer needed</li>
          <li>Immunity to level three spells now blocks the Slow spell explicitly</li>
          <li>Immunity to Kill Target now blocks the 'Undead Destroyed' string</li>
          <li>Remove Magic Not Dispelling Feeblemind is now a broader dispel magic   fix; specifically anything that dispels magic will now properly cure   feeblemind and deafness as well as destroy illusionary creatures.   Numerous calls to destroy magically created items are removed, as they   are not needed</li>
          <li>The fixes for the shapeshifting spells (both from-human and to-human) are now done as batch patches</li>
          <li>New batches for remove fear (not fear immunity), full stun, immunity   to feeblemind, immunity to psionics,and immunity to individual spell   schools have been added.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The fix for Peony's dialogue to correctly check Maria's DV was, in turn, breaking a variable check</li>
      <li>A romance fix for one of Aerie's lovetalk was overriding a fix for dialogues checking the wrong romance variable</li>
      <li>The dialogue branch created to fix the Captain Arat infinite fire   arrow exploit was setting the journal entry to the wrong category</li>
      <li>Vittorio will now open the door to Delosar's Inn when he goes there</li>
      <li>The fix to the XP exploit with Ellie the Festhall Cook has been tightened further</li>
      <li>The XP exploit in Spellhold (bringing the Hand of Dace and Crystal   Shard) now also explicitly opens and unlocks the door as a failsafe.   While Fixpack had no reports of issues here, the same fix in EE would   get an occasional report of flakiness.</li>
      <li>The kids in Umar Hills Kids Only Take One Bastard Sword missed a few actions</li>
      <li>The Anomen/Mazzy/Kiser Jhaeri fix is being withdrawn, as it's working as expected.</li>
      <li>In Anomen's Knighthood not being checked, one of the interjection   checks has been changed to exclude LN and CN Anomen (was excluding just   CN in v10), as the interjection only makes sense for LG Anomen.</li>
      <li>Another orientation when entering area fix was not being executed   due to some bad code, in this case, the Jansen home from the Slums</li>
      <li>Spell power fixes have been extended to a few more spells</li>
      <li>Casting speeds of innate abilities such as rage, kai, and berserk are now instant</li>
      <li>The NO VALID LINKS OR REPLIES issue for Cernd is a little more thorough</li>
      <li>More planar sphere fixes, as one of the apprentices was checking a bad value</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following were fixed in the 10.01 beta core fixes and moved   to the v11 Beta 1 core fixes, but were never documented previously.
    <ul>
      <li>TorGal's hit dice were increased to 16 to better reflect her abilities.</li>
      <li>During the thief stronghold quests, the map note indicating you've   taken over Mae'Var's guild simply covers the old map note. ToB has an   action to remove map notes, so now the old map note is removed in ToB   games when the new one is added.</li>
      <li>Using the Mask of King Strohm to detect the invisible guardian is a little more reliable</li>
      <li>Hannah, the mother trapped in the circus illusion, could be exploited for multiple XP rewards</li>
      <li>One mind flayer in the Underdark mind flayer lair was supposed to   continually respawn to give the player a steady supply of flayers to   open doors, but a flaky Die() trigger could prevent respawn</li>
      <li>One of the generic combat AI scripts for healers could cast bless way, way before combat</li>
      <li>If the player mashed through the wish genie's dialogue fast enough, they could end up with a NO VALID LINKS OR REPLIES</li>
      <li>Another orientation when entering area fix, this one in Cayia's house in Brynnlaw</li>
      <li>Several items had equipping effects which could be dispelled</li>
      <li>Eagle Bow had an extraneous APR bonus</li>
      <li>Catti-Brie's bow was doing too much damage</li>
      <li>Robes of the Archmagi now provide a magic resistance icon when worn; Frostbrand provides a fire resistance icon</li>
      <li>Various items had incorrect ground icons.</li>
      <li>Ruby Pendant lacked an icon for its ability</li>
      <li>Rod of Terror used the wrong icon for the quickbar</li>
      <li>Duration fix for the avenger version of Animal Summoning II</li>
      <li>Ray of Enfeeblement has the wrong save penalty for its combat feedback</li>
      <li>The active romance variables are now only set if the PC is a match;   these caused problems for scripts and dialogues down the line</li>
      <li>The player could take control in a dream sequence</li>
      <li>Gaelan has checks for the wrong amount of gold in a couple of places in his dialogue</li>
      <li>Several dialogues had missing journal entries; one of these (for JAHEIRAJ) was setting a journal entry in the wrong state in v10</li>
      <li>One of Jaheira's dialogue should branch depending on whether the PC is a jerk</li>
      <li>One of Vincenzo's dialogues was cutting out early, missing the last couple of lines</li>
      <li>If you asked about gold storage in your first dialogue with the   de'Arnise majordomo, Lady Delcia would never leave. Also the majordomo   wasn't recognizing Nalia in some dialogues.</li>
      <li>Lavok was missing XP rewards in some of his closing dialogue branches</li>
      <li>If you didn't grab the tree nuts before heading to the penultimate   Irenicus encounter at the Tree of Life, you were trapped and unable to   continue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following are new and in the core fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Psionic Blast was assigned a name so that it would show up in the combat log.</li>
      <li>CD_STATE_NOTVALID has been added as a state.</li>
      <li>The Small Teeth Pass was also using a leftover BG area script; this is now blanked</li>
      <li>The fighter2, thief1 and thief2 player AI scripts no longer try to hide in shadows with classes that lack the ability</li>
      <li>The thief3 and thief4 player AI scripts no longer try to detect traps with classes that lack the ability</li>
      <li>The player was not their XP reward for re-assembling the illithid rod in Watcher's Keep due to a typo</li>
      <li>If Delon was spawned later for the ogron attack/Umar events, he could leave prematurely or spam his original offer stringheads</li>
      <li>Wand of Fire in ar0065 was undercharged</li>
      <li>Another orientation when entering area fix, the thief guild hall (Mae'Var and PC) third floor entrance from the outside</li>
      <li>A peasant woman was using the peasant man animation</li>
      <li>One of the rebels in Saradush gets hi spear moved to an available weapon slot</li>
      <li>The invisible creature that controlled the Ust Natha tavern combat music is set to neutral to prevent save silliness</li>
      <li>The Eagle Bow and some arrows were erroneously applying strength bonuses</li>
      <li>The fix to add feedback and portrait icons to the stun effects of   Darts of Stunning has been extended to several other items that stun</li>
      <li>The Silver Sword now displays combat feedback of 'Vorpal Hit' on vorpal hits</li>
      <li>The Unholy Reaver (undroppable weapon of a Githyanki anti-paladin)   was dispelling magic on its wielder instead of its target and had no   visuals due to a typo</li>
      <li>Spell failure for good mages from Unholy Word didn't work at all</li>
      <li>The Helmite ghost at Watcher's Keep can fail to set some variables if party members are mazed</li>
      <li>If you decide to kill the countess in Saradush, your good party   members more or less abandon you on the spot. LG Anomen objects if he's a   member of the NORH, but not LN, and he's omitted from many of the mass   exodus commands in the subsequent dialogues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Optional But Cool Changes
    <ul>
      <li>Improved Spell Animations now adjusts maze animations for maze   via special snare or psionic maze, whereas previously it only did so for   the arcane version. Enemy symbol spells now use the same animations as   player symbol spells.</li>
      <li>Cromwell's Forging Actually Takes a Day now has the option to designate a day as 8 or 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Mixed-Use Dagger Fixes now removes the melee tooltips from tooltip.2da.</li>
      <li>Ghreyfain's Holy Symbol Fixes now directly grant   Aerie/Anomen/Viconia the correct holy symbols instead of swapping them   after being granted the old, incorrect one</li>
      <li>Additional Alignment Fixes outsources to separate file for easier player editing, like the main component alignment changes</li>
      <li>Remove Thieving Start Bonuses from Bard and Ranger Skills no longer   adjusts stealth score in joinable ranger creature files (e.g. Minsc), as   the engine pulls the correct value from the table upon them joining the   party  </li>
    </ul>
