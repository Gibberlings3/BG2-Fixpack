@1000856 = ~The journal lists a number of experiments, apparently conducted by a mage known as Lium the Lucky. The section dealing with the machine in front of you draws your eye:

"What a wondrous contraption! It creates, enchants, and dispenses magical equipment of no small power by pulling these six levers in the correct order. The ranking of the levers seems to change daily and pulling them in the incorrect order results in painful and instant death, as I've deduced from the bloodstains on the floor. I've gotten the order correct for the last few days and sent the items home with Pooky. It is well that I found the machine when I did for it hasn't much life left. Each item it creates damages the inner workings further and soon I fear it shall fall apart. The previous order was:
1) Ruby
2) Jade
3) Mithral
4) Onyx
5) Emerald
6) Sandalwood. 

I've taken apart what pieces of the machine I could, and found the device that sets the ranking of the levers. With it, as stated, the order for the past several days was clear. Now the cursed thing has broken and I've garnered hardly any information from it at all. This is what I *have* discovered:
A) The Jade Lever's change in ranking was the greatest of the six levers.
B) The product of the Onyx Lever's rankings for the two days (when multiplied) is same as the product of the Sandalwood Lever's last two rankings when multiplied.
C) None of the levers are ever in the exact same place in line as they were yesterday.
D) Obviously, due to the change in the Jade Lever's order, there are only two possibility's regarding the change in the orders of the Onyx and Sandalwood Levers, one of which contradicts another clue.
E)  It is likely that the Mithral lever moved the same number of rankings as the Sandalwood Lever.

Quite the dilemma and the guesswork is risky. However, the items I've obtained are worth the risk and, with logic, I'm sure that I'll discover the correct order for today."

The journal says no more.~

A foreigner from the east who went by the name of Floating Bear became well known through the Sword Coast.  Unarmed and unarmored he bested many powerful warriors.  One night, in the arms of a lady of the night, he whispered his secret.  His martial arts training was supplemented by the thin gauntlets he wore, which allowed him to hit more accurately and with harder punches than bare fists would normally allow.  The woman stole the gloves and took the next boat out.  Floating Bear soon left, returning to his homeland.

Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around him, such as opening doors, or opening a chest.  He can, however, cast defensive spells on himself and fellow party members.  And if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first.~
@1002972 = ~Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills

Delon of Imnesvale came and told me of a group of orcs that seems to have come down from the hills and attacked the village. I have other things to do, so the boy left. If I change my mind, I should go to the village within three days or it will be too late.~

I managed to fight off the orcs and rescue Madulf the ogre, who had taken shelter in the nearby cave after his fellows were driven off.~
@1002974 = ~Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills

I came to the village and saved it from attack by a clan of orcs that had come down from the mountains. Madulf the ogre, it seems, protected the village despite not having an alliance. The mayor was surprised and is going to speak to the ogre about the possibility, now.~

@1004396 = ~This journal was found on the body of the shadow-slain warrior that you stumbled upon near the entrance to the dark woods. The last entry is of particular interest:

"Nothing is as I'd imagined that it would be. I expected to become a hero when I joined Mazzy Fentan's party. I expected that we would slay monsters with ease and bask in the glory of victory as they do in the old tales. But it is not as it seems.

I did not expect the drudgery of the march, the casual horror of slaughter, the smell of death everywhere. I swear I can taste it! We've killed so many shadows and black wolves that my brain has become as numb as my arm. I am covered in ichor but have not the energy to even clean myself.

If not for Mazzy I think that I would be mad. She is a constant source of strength and always reminds us of the innocents that these beasts have killed, of the horror that we must take upon ourselves to save the people who have no defense. Mazzy is the hero here, not I.

The battle has only just begun. Today we arrived at the entrance to the ruined temple. It was crawling with shadows. Were it not for Mazzy's quick thinking we would surely be dead. There were far too many to fight but Mazzy used the stained glass of the ruins to reflect what light we had, illuminating the entrance and sending the shades to their doom. While the stained glass caught the light, we were able to find a pocket of safety. Any shadows that came within were destroyed by the light.

Tomorrow we will attempt to enter the temple and the darkness. I have never felt such dread. I try to be as brave as Mazzy but cannot. I feel the horrible inescapable urge to run and when the battle is joined, I can only hope that I will not."~

Isaea has returned and arrested Nalia through the abuse of his own power in the military. He claims that she is 'under bad influences' and not acting according to her station. Nalia protested, but he is the only one who can be complained to, apparently, so there seems to be no recourse. I am not even sure where she is being held.~

The High Priestess seemed to think that I was the one spoken of in her prophecy, and that I will save this Sahuagin city.

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry...or so it is said.  Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose.  "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough -it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself- but whomever constructed it remains a mystery.  It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is...wrong.  It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right.  It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him...or any other humanoid.

The tale of this weapon lost its significance in the sea of great stories that are told about the High forest, but some bards still sing the song of the skilled archer Adaniss Rhyte.
 
Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

The evil lord demand justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

'With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

Again called the forest with its precious game
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut
But first flew Adaniss' axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off 
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

@1007344 = ~Halberd +2:  'Suryris' Blade'
Suryris, a white minotaur who traveled the Orsraun mountains in Turmish, lived for nothing but the thrill of combat, and encouraged warriors to challenge him for his magical weapon: a powerful halberd.  Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower.  Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat.  The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryis knew he likely would have been bested had it continued.  He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.

@1007345 = ~Bastard sword +1, +3 vs. Shapeshifters:  'Kondar'
At first glance, this sword appears much like any other.  In the presence of any shapeshifting creature however, the blade becomes warm as its power stirs.  Its namesake was the original owner of the weapon, and his tale, though mostly long forgotten, was wrought with treachery and deceit.  Rumors persist that he paid a fearsome price for this blade, but with it he revealed the true identities of those that sought to betray him.  Their names and crimes however, are long since lost to history.

@1007346 = ~Long Sword +2:  'Varscona'
Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies.  Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power.  In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form.  Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity.  Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts.  Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated, she became one with the very blade of her weapon.  Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own.  It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers.  In his loneliness he spent many hours alone in the hills overlooking Trademeet.  A nearby wizard, Galloma, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul.  The two fast became friends; master and apprentice.  Galloma died before Dramnek's tutorage could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world.  Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla.  There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma.  Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced Dramnek's weak physical body.  This weapon has no speed factor.

These enchanted boots were once the property of a deadly assassin fond of chasing down his prey.  He moved with such speed that his targets often didn't have the opportunity to respond, even on horseback.  Over time the assassin's fame spread, and though his name was never known, all knew to fear the words last heard by his victims: "you can hide, but you cannot run!"

As predicted, enemy troops attempted to seize the King and force their will over his rule, but none had anticipated the amazing accuracy and lethality of the hidden archers.

Level: 6
Range: Self
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1

The attacks of powerful monsters are also considered magical weapons.  This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is protected from normal weapons, nor on anyone protected by mantle, improved mantle, or absolute immunity.  Due to the nature of this spell, with the short speed factor and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.

Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

When a Power Word, Stun spell is uttered, any creature of the mage's choice within visual range is stunned for the duration depending on its current hit points.  Creatures with 1 to 29 hit points are stunned for 4d4 rounds, those with 30 to 59 are stunned for 2d4 rounds, those with 60 to 89 are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and those with 90 or over are not affected.

Level: 8
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None

All of the effects of blindness apply to the victims, such as a penalty to hit and to AC.  As well the visibility range of the afflicted character is decreased.~
@1007788 = ~Phantom Blade (Evocation)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands.  This silent construct is blade-shaped.  Its cutting edges inflict damage just as do those of a real sword.  The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with this weapon, at her normal THAC0.
        The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit.  However, due to its etheric nature it causes an extra +10 damage against undead.  This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in her hand for the duration or until dispelled.~
@1007808 = ~Tenser's Transformation (Alteration) 
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power.  For when the wizard casts the spell, he undergoes a startling transformation.  The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, so he becomes a formidable fighting machine.  The spell causes the caster to become a berserk fighter.
          The wizard's hit points double, and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained.  The armor class of the wizard is 4 better than he possessed prior casting the spell, up to a maximum armor class of -10.
          All attacks are as a fighter of the same level as the wizard (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved for fighters).  As well, each attack is made at +2, and each successful hit in combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage.  The effect lasts for the duration or until dispelled.  NOTE: This spell does not give the caster any extra attacks.~
@1007818 = ~Sling +3: 'Arla's Dragonbane'~

@1007870 = ~What you say holds truth yet, as my father says, I am honor-bound to find my sister's killer and take his life.~
@1007931 = ~Protection From Magic Energy (Abjuration)

(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the elemental plane of Air.  This 8-hit-dice monster obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death.  The creature remains under the caster's control for 9 hours or until it is killed -- at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.~
@1008064 = ~Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth-and-higher-level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by forms of magical attack such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic.~
@1008065 = ~Flesh to Stone (Alteration) 
Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect:  1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns flesh of any sort to stone.  All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone.  The intended subject of the spell receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.

It appears that Tolgerias, a Cowled Wizard, has taken my promise to perform an unnamed service for him seriously. He had asked me to track down a man by the name of Valygar Corthala and bring him back dead or alive. I refused... and may face retaliation from the Cowled Wizards as a result.~

@1008486 = ~Delryn Family Shield +1

This is Anomen's family shield, given to him by his father.  In addition to the magical protection, the shield radiates an aura that grants the wielder fire and cold resistance.

@1008505 = ~Staff of the High Forest

This staff was the culmination of a cycle of seasons in which Cernd meditated on his role within nature.  His perch for this personal journey was next to a sapling, a young oak that was a particular interest of study; it seemed odd, and yet somehow wonderfully ordered.  At the coming of spring Cernd examined it one last time, and it came loose in his hands, a living staff, granted as boon from nature herself.  It has grown to fit his grip, and few others may wield it.

To his shame, Dynaheir is now dead, and he fears that the doors of the honored Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge are forever closed to him. This personal tragedy has obviously not strengthened Minsc's hold on reality, as evidenced by his continued dependence on his animal companion 'Boo', a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster.

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the 7th-level Spell Turning, which causes the spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster.  This affects a total of 4 spell levels.  This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary, such as cloud kill and stinking cloud.  As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be reflected back upon the caster.  This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be reflected.  For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while canceling the spell turning.

As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be absorbed.  This spell will only affect up to 7th-level spells, but if it tries to absorb a spell that goes over its limit, the spell will fail and the spell deflection will be canceled.  For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection.~

As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be reflected back upon the caster.  Something to note is that as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be reflected.

This powerful spell enables the priest to imbue 1 creature with the ability to regenerate.  This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs.  The creature affected will regain 3 hit points per second.  The effect lasts for 1 round per every 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled.  For example, a 14th-level priest would regenerate 18 hit points per round for 7 rounds.~

Level: 7

Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels

Saving Throw: Special 

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All creatures within the area of effect are allowed saving throws vs. spell with - 2 penalties.  Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. 

The spell lasts for one round for every two levels of the caster.  Those who fail their saving throws will go berserk, stand confused or wander about for the duration of the spell.
Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.).  Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest as well as area effects that are stationary, such as cloud kill and stinking cloud.  As long as the spell is cast directly at the priest it will be absorbed.  As long as there are spell levels remaining this will absorb the spell.  For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.~

When blown upon, no sound issues from the horn.  Instead the user of the horn is incased in a globe of power for a short duration.  The bubble gives the user partial magic resistance and a saving throw bonus, as well as partially deflecting incoming missile attacks.  The effect only lasts 18 seconds, and the horn draws from the life force of the user every time it is used.

@1012029 = ~Minor Globe of Invulnerability~
@1012145 = ~Remove Magic (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special

This is the combat version of dispel magic; it will only affect opponents.  A remove magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area.  This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items, such as wands.  It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items.  The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%.  For every level that the caster of the dispel magic is above the original caster, his chance of success increases by 5%.  For every level that the caster of dispel magic is below the original caster, his chance of success decreases by 10%.  However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure.  Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success.  Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.
Note:  while this spell dispels the individual effects of grease, web, stinking cloud and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.  
NOTE: this spell will ONLY affect ENEMIES.~
@1012146 = ~Minor Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the minor globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the minor globe. Fourth-and-higher-level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by forms of magical attack such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic.~
@1012149 = ~Protection From Normal Missiles
(Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: Touch 
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

By means of this spell, the wizard bestows total invulnerability to non-magical hurled and projected missiles, such as arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, and sling stones.  Note, however, that this spell does not convey any protection from such magical attacks as Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, Magic Missiles, or magical missiles, such as arrows +1.~
@1012156 = ~Monster Summoning I 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 3
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

With the casting of this spell, the wizard summons a random selection of 3-HD monsters.  There is a 60% chance of receiving one monster and a 40% chance of receiving two monsters.  The monster(s) appear within spell range and attack the spellcaster's opponents until the spell duration expires or until they are slain.~
@1012157 = ~Monster Summoning II 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 4
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is much like the 3rd-level monster summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 4-HD monsters. There is a 60% chance of receiving one monster and a 40% chance of receiving two monsters.  These monster(s) appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires, or until they are slain.~
@1012158 = ~Monster Summoning III 
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 5
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is much like the 3rd-level monster summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 5-HD monsters. There is a 60% chance of receiving one monster and a 40% chance of receiving two monsters.  These monster(s) appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires, or until they are slain.~
@1012163 = ~Detect Invisibility (Divination) 
Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 120-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

When the wizard casts a detect invisibility spell, he is able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addition, it enables the wizard to detect hidden or concealed creatures (e.g., thieves in shadows, halflings in underbrush, and so on). It does not reveal the method of concealment or invisibility, except in the case of astral travelers (where the silver cord can be seen). It does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects.  Note:  if an invisible creature enters the area of effect after the spell has already been cast, then the creature will remain invisible.~
@1012166 = ~Confusion (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/6 levels 
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action.  All creatures within the area of effect are allowed save vs. spell with a -2 penalty.  Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. 

The spell lasts for five rounds plus one round for every 6 levels of the caster.  Those who fail their saving throws will go berserk, stand confused or wander about for the duration of the spell.
Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.).  Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~
@1012168 = ~Dire Charm
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Range: 20 yards
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell works in the exact same manner as charm person, with one difference: there is no saving throw bonus.  Dire charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected.  The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.
If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken. 
If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.  Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. 
Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he was charmed.~
@1012173 = ~Agannazar's Scorcher (Evocation)
Level: 2
Range: 20 yards
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2-foot by 60-foot jet.
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be hit by this flame for 3-18 points of damage.  There is no saving throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as fire resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage. Other creatures who cross the path of the flame jet will also take damage as long as they stand in the flame.~
@1012174 = ~Chromatic Orb
(Evocation)
Level: 1
Range: 30 yards
Duration: special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand.  When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly to its target.  The effect the orb has upon the target varies with the level of the mage who casts the spell.  Each orb will do damage to the target against which there is no save and an effect against which the target must save vs. spells at +6.  At first level, the sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and blinds the target for one round.  At second level, the sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and inflicts pain upon the victim.  At third level, the sphere deals 1-6 damage and burns the victim.  At fourth level, the sphere deals 1-6 damage and blinds the target for 1 turn.  At fifth level, the sphere deals 1-8 damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.  At sixth level, the sphere deals 1-8 damage and causes weakness in the victim.  At seventh level, the sphere deals 1-10 damage and paralyzes the victim for 2 turns.  At 10th level, the sphere causes 1-12 acid damage and turns the victim to stone.  At 12th level, the sphere will inflict 2-16 points of acid damage and instantly kill the victim.  
NOTE: The victim saves vs spells at +6 against all the effects and gets no save against the damage.~
@1012180 = ~Magic Missile (Evocation) 
Level: 1
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first-level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile - he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, and a maximum of five missiles at 9th level.~
@1012188 = ~Horror (Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: 25 yards
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg. 

All enemies within the area of effect when this spell is cast must save vs. spells or flee in terror.  Certain creatures are immune to the effects of fear, including all undead.~
@1012190 = ~Vampiric Touch 
(Necromancy) 
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: Target creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the target loses 1-6 hit points for every two caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6-36 for a 12th-level caster.  These hit points are added to the caster's current hit points, with any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary, additional hit points.  The temporary hit points last for 5 turns.

Note: This spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's hit-points.  The caster must wait for the first vampiric touch spell to run its course before casting another.~
@1012193 = ~Haste (Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all creatures affected function at double their normal movement rate, gain a -2 initiative bonus, and receive an extra attack each round. Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all allied creatures in a 15-foot radius centered on a point selected by the caster (thus, creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). Note that affected creatures expend as much energy during this spell as they would normally in a whole day, significantly raising their fatigue level. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. Note that this spell negates the effects of a slow spell.~
@1012196 = ~Slow (Alteration) 
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect:  15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

A slow spell causes creatures to move and attack at half of their normal rates unless a save vs. spells is made with a -4 penalty.  It negates haste, but does not otherwise affect magically hasted or slowed creatures.  Slowed creatures have an armor class penalty of +4, and an attack penalty of -4.~
@1012197 = ~Strength (Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn/level 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Target creature
Saving Throw: None 

Application of this spell increases the Strength of the character to 18 and then adds a 50% bonus on top of this.   The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate.  For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then his strength will just be set to 18/00.  If a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then his strength will become 18/50 +original percentage.  If his strength is less than 18, then it will just become 18/50.  However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more.~
@1012202 = ~Protection From Fire (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

The effects of a protection from fire spell last no longer than three rounds plus one round per caster level.  When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like).  Likewise this spell absorbs 80% of all damage done by magical fires such as fiery dragon breath, spells such as burning hands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame strike, meteor swarm, hell hound or pyrohydra breath, etc.~
@1012204 = ~Remove fear (Abjuration)
Level: 1
Sphere: Charm 
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

The priest instills courage in the spell recipients, raising their morale to its highest.  The recipients' morale will gradually reset to normal as the duration runs out.  If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated.~
@1012205 = ~Remove Paralysis (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection 
Range: 10 yards/level 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

By the use of this spell, the priest can free several creatures from the effects of any paralyzation or related magic (such as a ghoul touch, or a hold spell).~
@1012212 = ~Call lightning (Alteration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Weather 
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 turn/ 4 levels
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 360-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

When a call lightning spell is cast, it must be cast outside, otherwise it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn.  The spell has a duration of one turn for every four levels of the caster. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 8th-level caster will call down two bolts, each doing 10d8 (2d8 + 8d8) damage. 
The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies.  The first enemy struck by the lightning will be the enemy targeted.  After that any enemy (but not allies) may be struck by the ensuing lightning storm.~
@1012214 = ~Animal Summoning I
(Conjuration, Summoning)
Level: 4
Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 20 yards
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 7 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By means of this spell, the caster calls between two and three animals that have 4 Hit Dice or less.  The animals appearing are randomly determined.  They will remain under the caster's control until slain or the spell duration expires.~
@1012219 = ~Detect Evil (Divination)
Level: 2
Sphere: All 
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell discovers emanations of evil from any creature. Any evil creature within the range of the spell will glow red briefly.~
@1012220 = ~Find Traps (Divination)
Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him.  Once each round all of the traps within a 30-foot radius of the caster will be revealed.  A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus, traps include glyphs and similar spells or devices.~
@1012221 = ~Invisibility Purge (Divination)
Level: 3
Sphere: Divination
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 120-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

Any invisible creatures within the area of effect have their invisibility dispelled.  This includes creatures that are in sanctuary, improved invisibility, and shadow door.~
@1012314 = ~Hold Animal (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Animal
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Target, and anyone within 5 feet 
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds animals rigidly immobile and in place.  Only normal and giant-sized animals are affected by this spell.  Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs and carrion crawlers do not count as animals.
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster.  Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected.  Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell.  
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@1012317 = ~Magical Stone (Enchantment) 
Level: 1
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By using this spell, the priest can create a small magical pebble, which then flies out and hits a target opponent.  The stone deals 1-4 damage to whomever it hits.  The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus.~
@1012320 = ~Draw Upon Holy Might (Invocation) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat 
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

The priest calls upon his god to grant him power for a short period.  When he does this, his strength, constitution and dexterity all are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster.  A third-level caster would have his abilities raised by 1, while a 12th-level caster would have all his abilities raised by 4.~

@1013137 = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire.  Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there.  Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places - Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr - took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change.  As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born.  It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calimshite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the Forgotten Realms.  Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn.  The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim.   A force that great, they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the Realms, and that didn't happen.  Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land.  There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its power over its own area.  About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land.  Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do.  The oldest son of each Pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one.  The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental
Range: Special
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw:  1/2 damage

Casting the fire seed spell creates 4 fire seeds that will appear in the caster's inventory.  The seeds will remain in existence after the spell is cast for 3 turns.  During this time, if they are thrown at an enemy, a fireball will ensue, causing 2-16 points of damage to all within the area of effect, allowing a save vs. spells for half damage.~

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature -- a Pit Fiend -- to attack his foes and himself if he's not careful. The caster must use a Protection from Evil on himself (and comrades) to keep the devil from noticing them.  If the caster fails to protect himself in this manner, the Pit Fiend will tear the caster and his companions apart, piece by piece and then feast on the remains.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental, Summoning
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting a conjure earth elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the elemental plane of Earth, and an earth elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster.  It is 60% likely that a 12-hit-dice elemental appears, 35% likely that a 16-hit-dice elemental appears, and 5% likely that a 24-hit-dice elemental appears.  All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. Priests do not have to engage in a battle of the wits to control their summoned elemental (unlike mages).  The elemental will remain under the caster's control until slain or until the spell duration expires.~

The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain, or the duration of the spell runs out.  All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and no need to know the language of the summoned creature.  Unlike the mage elemental conjuring spells, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.~

This spell does not give the new form's other abilities such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

When the spell is cast, for the duration of the spell the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as he wishes.  The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others.  The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form.  Also, any natural protections that the new form offer are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and blunt weapons possessed by the slime form.

The possible forms given by polymorph self are:
(1) Gnoll: wields a magical halberd (+1 fire damage and strikes as an enchanted weapon +3)
(2) Mustard Jelly: capable of slowing opponents (if they fail a save when hit).
(3) Ogre: capable of causing massive damage with its fists

In addition the caster may choose the form of spider, brown bear, black bear or wolf.~

@1022609 = ~Spirit Armor (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range:  Touch
Duration: 10 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the 3rd-level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates a corporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell.  This spell taps the target's life force in order to create the barrier.  The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor, however dexterity bonuses still apply as well as magic rings and a shield.  While in effect the AC (armor class) of the recipient will be 1, as if he was wearing full plate.  Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, he will also receive a +3 bonus to save vs. spell.

There is a danger however, as when the spell runs out the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon the target, unless the creature makes a saving throw vs. spell.~
@1022611 = ~Chaos (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/6 levels
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th-level spell confusion in all respects.   The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking, either friend or foe.  If the victim is 4th level or lower, he does not receive a saving throw versus the effects.  However, if the victim is 5th level or higher, he receives a save vs. spell at -4.  The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful dispel magic is cast.~
@1022615 = ~Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

The domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect.  This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim.  Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals.  This effect can only be reversed by dispel magic.  The target gets a saving throw vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@1022617 = ~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 5-foot radius around target
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds 1d4 creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for nine or more rounds, unless a save vs. spells is made with a -2 penalty.
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster.  Any enemies within 5 feet of the target are also affected.  Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. 
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech.  Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@1022621 = ~Protection From Lightning (Abjuration) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: Touch 
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 7 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to electrical attacks, such as magical attacks (lightning bolt, shocking grasp etc..)  The protection will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.~

@1022712 = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun.  Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence.  The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

@1022834 = ~Champion's Strength (Alteration) 
Level: 5
Sphere:  Law
Range:  Visual sight of caster 
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of his god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion.  The target gains a bonus to his THAC0 at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster.  So a 9th-level priest would confer a THAC0 bonus of 3 to the target, and so on.  Also, the target's strength is set to 18/00 for the duration of the spell, with all the bonuses to hit and damage that this strength confers.  Note that if the targets strength is above 18/00, it will actually be reduced to this value.
The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and his god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time.  The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~

@1022972 = ~Say that again, in public, and you'll lose your tongue.  We'll be watching you...so ensure that you repeat that information nowhere.  Now get moving.~

@1023378 = ~The scimitar, or "shamshir" as it was originally called, has a single-edged blade with a significant curve, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  It is perhaps slower than other weapons of the same type, though it compensates by the amount of damage it is capable of.  This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder.

A soldier named Khellor told me of how I might be able to expose Isaea's corruption and secure Nalia's release. A contact of Isaea's is named Barg and can be located at the docks in the Docks District. He also said I might look into Isaea's records at his home just northwest of the government building in the Government District.

Valygar's quest is finally done. Lavok was not what he expected, and has caused the normally judgmental ranger to think deeply about what he has experienced. With the necromancer dead and the Cowled Wizards no longer hunting him, the ranger has gone on his own way. I doubt I shall see him again.~

@1024797 = ~Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 5
Range: 15 yards
Duration: 1 turn +1 round/level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

A caster who performs a conjure lesser earth elemental spell summons an earth elemental to do his bidding.  The elemental is 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell duration expires or until the elemental's death.  However, every time this spell is cast there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster, upon which it will go berserk, attacking the mage who dared summon it.  If it can't reach the summoner it will fight its way towards him.  This berserking elemental will also remain until slain, or the spell duration expires.  This spell requires rigid concentration after the casting in order to implant control in the summoned creature's psyche.  The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for three rounds after being summoned.  At the end of this time, if the caster has won, he has control of the elemental.  However, if he has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill him.  This does not prevent the use of other charm-type spells, cast afterwards if the contest was lost.  It might be good to note that if charm spells are used before the contest is over they will have no effect on the outcome.~

Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting a conjure fire elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the elemental plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster.  It is 60% likely that a 12-hit-dice elemental appears, 35% likely that a 16-hit-dice elemental appears, and 5% likely that a 24-hit-dice elemental appears.  Once the elemental appears the caster must concentrate on the creature for 3 rounds in order to assure that the elemental will not turn on him (15% chance the elemental will attack the caster).  However, after this period has passed the elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain, or the duration of the spell runs out.

The creature he becomes is that of the Werewolf, the most famous of the lycanthrope shape changers.

The caster of the Armor of Faith receives significant protection against melee and magical attacks.  This magical armor is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster.  At first level, the protection is 5%, and every five levels of the caster improves this by another 5%.  A 20th-level priest would have 25% of her damage 'absorbed' if protected by this spell.~

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 120 feet in radius around the caster will be affected.  Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile illusion/phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled.  The spells that are affected by this are: Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum.  The area of effect is roughly a 120-foot radius around the caster.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.  This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~

@1025751 = ~Creeping Doom
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 80 yards
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, he calls forth a mass of venomous, biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpetlike mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all the creatures within 30 feet of the target.  Those trapped by the insects suffer 2 points of damage each second, and a spell failure rate of 100%.  For each round the victim remains inside the cloud he must make a save vs. spells at -2 or run away in fear for one round.  The advantage of Creeping Doom over its fifth-level counterpart Insect Plague is that it does twice as much damage in half the amount of time.~
@1025764 = ~Holy Word (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

Uttering a holy word spell creates magic of tremendous power.  The priest acts as a bridge between his god and the prime material plane, causing a small explosion centered on the priest and reaching up to a 15-foot radius.  It affects only evil creatures or undead of any alignment that are caught in the area of effect.  The effects differ according to the level of the target as follows:

Hit Dice or levels  --  Effects of Holy word
Less than 4  --  Death
4 to 7  --  Stunned for 1 turn
8 to 11  --  Slowed for 1 turn with 75% chance of spell failure
12 and up  --  Deafened for 1 turn with 50% chance of spell failure

There is no saving throw vs. this spell and the effects are instantaneous and last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.  Note this spell may not be cast by any priest of evil alignment.~
@1025766 = ~Resurrection (Necromancy)
Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature Touched
Saving Throw: None

Like the 5th-level spell Raise Dead, Resurrection will return a character back to life.  However, Resurrection also heals the character so that they are ready for the adventuring life once more.~
@1025783 = ~It is not the magic that is evil, but the purpose behind it, and the purpose of many magic users is good... something I am sure even you have benefited from somehow.~
@1025872 = ~Detect Illusion (Divination)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

When cast at a point designated by the wizard this spell will cancel all illusion/phantasm spells of 3rd level and lower in the area.  The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, and Non-detection.  It is important to note that the caster can control just who this spell affects.  Therefore, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party.  The area of effect is roughly a 15-foot radius around the target.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.~
@1025876 = ~Stoneskin (Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon himself, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering him.  This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks, such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every 2 levels of the caster an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level wizard would receive 10.  For each skin the wizard possesses the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him, but the sixth would affect him normally.  The skins will remain on the wizard until he is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks, such as fireball.~

@1025933 = ~Mislead (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 6
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from his original position.  Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where he used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster.  The image cannot perform any actions at all, such as attacking or casting spells.  It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage.  The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys illusions, such as True Sight.~
@1025935 = ~Pierce Magic (Abjuration) 
Level: 6
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Target Creature 
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects.  The first is that the creature's magic resistance will be lowered by 1% per level of the caster.  The second is that it will cancel one spell protection of 8th level or lower on the creature.  For example, if this spell was cast by a 15th-level wizard, the target creature would lose 15% magic resistance from his current total, reducing it to 0 if less than that remains, as well as cancelling one 8th-level-or-lower spell protection.  The list of spells that this includes is: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe Of Invulnerability.  Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.  The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.~
@1025936 = ~True Sight (Divination)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 120-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 120 feet in radius around the caster will be effected.  Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile illusion/phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled.  The spells that are affected by this are: Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum.  The area of effect is roughly a 120-foot radius around the caster.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.  This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~
@1025938 = ~Improved Haste (Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

Each affected creature functions at double its normal movement and attack rates. A hasted creature gains a - 2 initiative bonus. Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not sped up.  There are three major differences between the third-level wizard spell haste and this spell.  The first major difference is that there is no period of fatigue following the expiration of the spell.  The second major difference is that this spell will only affect one creature.  Third and finally, this haste spell actually doubles the number of attacks for the hasted creature.  Note that this spell negates the effects of a slow spell.  This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic.  This spell lasts for the duration or until dispelled.~
@1025943 = ~Contingency (Evocation) 
Level: 6
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of his repertoire of known spells.  One spell level for every three levels of the caster is allowed, up to 18th level or 6th-level spells.  Once the spell is chosen the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided.  The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of his/her hit points to an enemy being sighted.  Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.  For example a 12th-level wizard could place the spell stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of his hit points'.  Then, in combat, once the wizard is reduced to 50% of his hit points or below, stoneskin would be immediately cast upon him.  This requires no action by the wizard, it happens automatically and instantaneously.  The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster.  Therefore it cannot be an offensive spell and cannot target any other party members.~
@1025945 = ~Project Image (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 7
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: caster
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast there is a illusionary copy made of the casting wizard which steps out of his body.  This copy can move around, it has the same hit points and can cast the same spells, however, it cannot make any physical attacks.  If the image is destroyed then the spell ends and the caster can move again.  Also, if during this time the caster takes any damage, the image will disappear and the caster can move around again.  Otherwise the image will remain for the duration of the spell or until affected by a dispel magic or anything that dispels illusions, such as True Sight.~
@1025948 = ~Khelben's Warding Whip (Abjuration) 
Level: 7
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast on the target creature it will dispel one spell protection of up to 8th level in strength.  Every round thereafter, till the duration of the spell expires, another spell protection will be removed from the target.  The spells that are affected by this are: Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Deflection and Spell Shield.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.  This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target, and if there are two protecting a mage that are the same level the choice is random.~
@1025954 = ~Sphere of Chaos (Alteration)
Level: 7
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special

All enemies within the area of effect must make a save vs. spells every round that they remain in the sphere, and if the save is failed one of the following random effects occurs:  polymorphed into a squirrel, confused, burst into flames, paralyzed, disintegrated, healed 20 hit points, randomly teleported, rendered unconscious or hasted.~
@1025959 = ~Delayed Blast Fireball (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 7
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 12-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a fireball that hovers at a point determined by the caster.  The fireball will stay in position until someone walks too close to it, at which point it will explode for 15d6 points of damage with a save vs. spell for half damage.~

Level: 7
Range: 20 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 70' long cone 
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the wizard causes seven shimmering, multi-colored rays of light to flash from his hand.  These include all colors of the visible spectrum; each ray has a different power and purpose.  Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck by a ray is blinded for 5 rounds, regardless of any other effect.  Any creature that is caught within the area of effect will be touched by one or two of the rays.  The effects of the rays are listed below.

Red  -  Inflicts 20 hit points of damage, save vs. spell for half
Orange  -  Inflicts 40 hit points of damage, save. vs. spell for half
Yellow  -  Inflicts 80 hit points of damage, save vs. spell for half
Green  -  save vs. poison or die, if survive suffer 20 points of poison damage
Blue  -  save vs. petrification or be turned to stone
Indigo  -  save vs. wands or be feebleminded
Violet  -  save vs. spell or be disintegrated~
@1025991 = ~Interesting, but not of much help. Lots of people carry or wear leather.~
@1026021 = ~Neither of which is conclusive evidence. Lots of people have leather and a smell could be anything! You killed a man over this?~
@1026038 = ~Well, that evidence alone would not have allowed me to act against a businessman, but it seems to have served you well. The locals will appreciate that they are safe.~

@1026242 = ~Pierce Shield (Abjuration)
Level: 8
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses.  The target's magic resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster.  Next pierce shield will cancel one spell protection of any level.  For example, if this spell was cast by a 15th-level wizard the target creature would lose 25% magic resistance from his current total, reducing it to 0 if less than that remains, as well as cancelling one spell protection if the mage currently has one.  The list of spells that this includes is: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap.  Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.  The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.  It cannot be dispelled.~
@1026305 = ~Spell Trap (Abjuration)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster.  Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap -- making the caster recall a previously cast spell.  For example, a wizard shields himself with spell trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell).  He gets three spell levels back -- he will regain one spell, up to 3rd level in power.
The spell trap provides 30 levels of protection (e.g., ten flame arrows or five fingers of death).  The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~

This includes: Iron Skins, Magic Resistance, Shield of the Archons, Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@1026330 = ~Chain Contingency (Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The Caster
Saving Throw: None

Chain contingency channels some of the magical energy of the mage and releases it only under certain circumstances.  Basically, the mage chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions, such as being hit by an enemy.  When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately.  Spells of 8th level or lower may be used in the contingency.~
@1026342 = ~You can not place a two-handed weapon in your off hand.~

Level: 5
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell, the recipient receives a resistance to all magic.  The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the priest up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level.  This resistance is set so if the target already has more magic resistance than the priest would confer, it will actually lower it to the set value.  This effect will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@1026793 = ~Is that what you think I am? A traitor? I don't know if I can stomach this. I... I don't want to talk to you of this anymore.~

@1026815 = ~There are times when you seem almost reasonable, and then you say such things that only make me doubt myself. Perhaps... perhaps they were right? I don't know.~
@1026839 = ~If I am in the right, why must I tell their secrets? If I am in the right, why must I hide? I do not have answers for these questions, and they worry me.~
@1026868 = ~What?  You cannot give me a second to... Fine, if that is what you wish then you have already answered any question I might have said.  Let's go.  Now!  Go!~

@1029208 = ~Spider Spawn (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell the wizard conjures several spider eggs into existence, quickly producing fully grown spiders that remain under the wizard's telepathic control.  The type of spiders that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.
7th : giant spider
9th : phase spider
12th+ : sword spider
When the spell is cast there is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one.  These spider(s) will remain under the wizard's control until slain, or the spell duration expires.~
@1029212 = ~Carrion Summons (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

There are two parts to this spell.  When cast the first part is to open up a small portal which will summon 1 or 2 carrion crawlers to a point designated by the wizard.  The second part of the magic mutates the carrion crawlers into larger, more vicious versions of themselves.  The result is that the wizard now has control over these creature(s) until they are slain, or the spell duration expires.  When the spell is cast there is a 35% chance that two will be summoned instead of just one.~
@1029214 = ~Summon Nishruu (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting the summon nishruu spell the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the Nishruu.  At first glance this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination this boiling, churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own.  Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the nishruu feed on the energies surrounding and used by wizards.  Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.  The nishruu have no physical attacks at all.  However, they can be hurt by physical attacks.  Each time a nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around him there are two major effects.  First all magical items with charges that the target possesses will be drained by one charge, destroying them if only one remains.  The second is it causes the wizard to lose one memorized spell.  This is chosen at random. However, it will consume the highest level possible.  The nishruu is completely immune to magic (except for death spell), and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature.  The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, or the spell duration expires.~
@1029220 = ~Summon Hakeashar (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 8 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the 6th-level wizard spell, Summon Nishruu.  The Hakeashar is a more powerful version of the Nishruu, having more hit points, better attacks, and immunity to normal weapons.
By casting the summon hakeashar spell the wizard calls into being a magical being of considerable power: the Hakeashar.  At first glance this appears to be some sort of mist but upon closer examination this boiling, churning grey mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own.  Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, this creature feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards (and other spellcasters).  Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.  The hakeashar has no physical attacks at all.  However, it can be hurt by physical attacks.  Each time the creature touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around him there are two major effects.  First, all magical items with charges that the target possesses will be drained by one charge, destroying them if only one remains.  The second is it causes the wizard to lose one memorized spell.  This is chosen at random. However, it will consume the highest level possible.  The hakeashar is completely immune to magic, and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature.  The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, or the spell duration expires.~
@1029221 = ~Lower Resistance (Abjuration,Alteration)
Level: 5
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast upon a target creature this spell will lower the magic resistance of this creature by 10% + 1% per level of the caster.  There is no saving throw vs. this spell and magic resistance is ignored.  For example, if a creature has 60% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th-level mage then its magic resistance would be lowered by 25% automatically.  This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell.  If this spell was cast upon this same creature again the creatures magic resistance would be 60% - 25% (initial casting) - 25% (current casting) which would leave the creature with 10% magic resistance after both spells have been cast.  This spell will last until the spell duration expires.  Something to note is that this spell is not affected by dispel magic.  Once it has been cast there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.~

Ending the Plague of Teeth

This tome is quite ancient, and you do not recognize the tongue in which it is written. Fortunately, Bodhi has scrawled a translation of selected passages in the margins, as well as further questions she apparently wished to ask on the subject.

Stuat tuo Gotha:
The resolution:
With the witch at the fore, long previous to her treachery, we did stride the hills of Umar seeking comfort in our hour of need. The time had come for the living to mourn no more, and the blades that were fettered by sentiment were cut free, and it was decided that we would speak for our lives with the sinews of our sword arms. The honored dead that did take flight in the darkness of shadow would no more receive sorrow from those of us that had lost their friends and relatives to the plague of teeth.

Mornat de'pas Golvana Fathorn:
Battles when came the dead:
There came we, the army of light, armed with faith and conviction, and we did march unto the tombs of the restless dead during hours of day. With wooden edge we struck down master and slave, though many paid for each thrust with their lives. In the fallen there was the danger of a scourge anew, and many of the newly infected seemed doomed to walk again with dire purpose. 

Aegato Davon:
The plea:
"No more" cried we! No more would we lose to the plague. These new fallen could not be abandoned. We had fought for our lives and theirs, and they would not be taken. To the Temple we went, to the god of Sun and Light. Amaunator would save them. Amaunator, whose touch turns shadows to fire. In the arms of the Sun god were the infected placed, and the hearts of their dark masters were laid there with them. Blood did burn, and the dead returned, but not as undead or unliving, but alive and freed from taint. Many did walk the light side home, when last the plague did fall.

Relevance of archaic worship of Amaunator?
Origin of vampiric plague?
Any link to a modern cure to be worried of?
Historical document or historical fiction?

@1032336 = ~Alright. How high of a quota should be set for him? This will of course mean burgling more or less houses, so there may be increased risk to him.~

@1032410 = ~Control Undead (Necromancy)
Level: 7
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1-4 creatures
Saving Throw: Special

The control undead spell allows the caster to take control of 1-4 undead creatures within the area of effect.  This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control.  If the undead have 3 Hit Dice or less then there is no saving throw allowed, however if they have 4 Hit Dice or more a save vs. spells is allowed to negate the effect.  The undead remain under control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a dispel magic.~

(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes all creatures within 10' of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature(s) are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature(s) detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature(s) or their gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature(s) become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature(s). The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc. If they attack, they immediately become visible, although the invisibility enables them to attack first.~

So, too, have scoundrels and bandits been attracted to the area, and they prey mercilessly upon us.  I have found an excellent hiding place for my mithral cache, one which even those thieves will never be able to locate.  It is far to the northwest of the Imnesvale village, in a forest --"

Kaatje came to visit again. A sweet child, eager to learn my ways with the wild creatures.

Flamerule 12
Dark creatures roam the forests. Several townspeople have been slain by some unknown predator. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of what is doing the killing. The strangest thing is that the bodies are disappearing in the morning. This leaves me baffled, for most signs point to a pack of wolves that have been in the area for a long time. Wolves don't steal bodies.

Flamerule 13
Or perhaps I should say wolf-like creatures. At night while I've been patrolling I've often caught shadowy glimpses of these 'wolves' running alongside me. I've tried to attract their attention but they ignore me. I find this most strange, as if the pack is being controlled by someone else. Years ago I spoke with the pack leaders and they were cordial. Now they either flee from me, or, and I fear to say this, they stalk me.

Flamerule 21
It is near noon and still the wood outside my cabin seems full of shadows. I've been hard pressed to hear birds and most of the larger animals have long fled. I plan to find the wolf's den (this afternoon). I've drawn a map to it. All signs point to them as being the culprits, but what wolves act like these? They are wolves with the cunning of men.
And there is something else, a whispering in my mind. It is faint now, in the waking hours, but while I sleep I dream only of this voice and the face behind it. Whether it is connected to the voices, I do not know. I suspect by the time that the sun sets tonight I'll have answers to my questions.~ []
@1034071 = ~What I do know is that he is not the worst of your worries. The Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart will seek your death if something is not done quickly.~ []
@1034072 = ~I have friends among the Order. I will speak with them as quickly as possible. Perhaps I can persuade them to look on you with mercy. I can but try.~

@1034090 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot.  As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant.  He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match.  Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak.  His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree.  That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth.  He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero.  Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance".
It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence.  If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity.  He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.
As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away.  Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah!  Got 'im good", and "Beware my bite for it might...might...might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

These weapons are hard to find outside of Kara-Tur, so care must be taken when considering this proficiency.  After all, skill with the Katana is only helpful if you can find one.

WARNING:  Magical katanas are very rare in Baldur's Gate 2!

@1034171 = ~TWO-HANDED:

NOTE:  Magical two-handed weapons are more powerful than their single-handed counterparts.  This counterbalances the fact that you can't use a second weapon or shield when using a two-handed weapon.  The Holy avenger and Vorpal sword are examples of weapons that are two-handed.

This weapon class allows the character to use a two-handed weapon and receive special bonuses.  If one slot is spent on this proficiency the wielder gets a +1 bonus to damage and a -2 bonus to speed when using a two-handed weapon.  The character will also score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20).  A second slot spent on this proficiency gives a further -2 bonus to speed while wielding two-handed weapons.~
@1034173 = ~SWORD AND SHIELD:  Anyone can pick up a shield and get its basic protection bonuses, but by spending slots on this proficiency an adventurer can maximize the benefits received.  One slot spent gives a -2 bonus to AC against missile weapons.  Another slot spent increases the bonus to a total of -4.

NOTE:  Despite the name of this skill, any one-handed weapon in combination with a shield will receive the bonuses given by this skill.~
@1034174 = ~SINGLE WEAPON:  This weapon class is for characters who do not wish to use a shield but want some bonus when using a one-handed weapon.  With one slot spent on this proficiency, the wielder gets a -1 bonus to AC and inflicts critical damage on an attack roll of 19 or 20, if using a single weapon.  A second slot increases the AC bonus to a total of -2.~

@1034664 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has left the party to seek out Sir William on his own. He said that if he is not at the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart within two day's time... then he is likely dead. Either way, I should look for him there then.~
@1034665 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has left the party to reconcile with his wife. He said he would return to the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart after he was finished, perhaps after three days or so. I will look for him there then.~

@1035604 = ~Greater Restoration (Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Sphere:  Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the life-energy level of the recipient is raised.  This reverses any previous life-energy-level drain of the creature by a force or monster.  A restoration spell will also restore the intelligence of a creature affected by a feeblemind spell.  It also negates any form of insanity, such as confusion or berserk, fully heals the target, and cures any disease or poisons.  The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest and she will likely require rest immediately afterwards, as it will cause days worth of fatigue almost instantaneously.~
@1035626 = ~Well said and much appreciated by this formerly dour knight, my lady! 'Tis a grand thing to be complimented by a beautiful lady, especially one with your grace.~
@1035658 = ~Unholy Word (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

Uttering an Unholy Word spell creates magic of tremendous power.  The priest acts as a bridge between his god and the prime material plane, causing a small explosion centered on the priest and reaching up to a 15-foot radius.  It affects only good creatures or creatures of any good alignment that are caught in the area of effect.  The effects differ according to the level of the target as follows:

Hit Dice or levels  --  Effects of Unholy Word
Less than 4  --  Death
4 to 7  --  Stunned for 1 turn
8 to 11  --  Slowed for 1 turn with 75% chance of spell failure
12 and up  --  Deafened for 1 turn with 50% chance of spell failure

There is no saving throw vs. this spell and the effects are instantaneous and last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.  Note: priests of good alignment may not cast this spell.~

@1035963 = ~Katana
The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword which ends in a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation both complex and secret, and more an art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is rare. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@1038428 = ~You're a Tombelthen?  Well, perhaps this medallion belongs to you, then.  I found it with a note penned by an Idras Tombelthen not far from here.  Apparently, this was all the mithral he could find, here.~

@1038464 = ~Well, how is it with you, then, ranger?  Have you found Idras' store of mithral?~
@1038466 = ~I found this medallion, along with a note from Idras.  Apparently, he didn't have much luck...he used all his mithral to make this.~
@1038527 = ~We had to call the Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart to help... but they arrived too late to save many. You could have done much to prevent it.~

@1038567 = ~Cloak of Fear (Conjuration)
Sphere: Charm
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Self
Saving Throw: Neg.

Cloak of fear empowers the caster to radiate a personal aura of fear out to a 3-foot radius. All other characters and creatures within this aura must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or run away in panic for 4 rounds. Affected individuals may even drop items.  Party members are immune to the effects, although the aura of fear may still disturb them.~
@1038570 = ~False Dawn (Evocation)
Sphere: Sun
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

False dawn calls into existence a bright, reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, within the area of effect.  All undead creatures within a false dawn suffer 6d6 points of damage.  There is no saving throw against this damage.  Affected undead also act confused on the round after the false dawn appears.~
@1038572 = ~Dolorous Decay (Alteration, Necromancy)
Sphere: Combat, Necromatic
Level: 6
Range: 10 yards
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell affects a single living creature.  Dolorous decay is a rotting and withering of the body that spreads throughout the afflicted creature quickly.  The target creature will automatically be slowed for two rounds.  Furthermore, if the target fails the saving throw vs. poison at -2, each second it receives 1 point of damage, until a total of 50 hit-points of damage are inflicted.~
@1038574 = ~Wondrous Recall (Alteration)
Sphere: Charm, Creation
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This enables the caster to bring back into memory two spells that have been previously cast.  If no spells have been cast yet, then nothing happens.  Wondrous recall cannot recall 6th-level-or-greater spells.~
@1038608 = ~This flail has been in the care of Lord Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiated when compiled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

Stinking Cloud (Evocation)
Level: 2
Range: 30 yards
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special

When a stinking cloud is cast, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 30 yards away from his position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be reeling and fall down for 1-2 rounds.  Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round.  A dispel magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud then they are still subject to its effects.~
@1039443 = ~Dwarven Thrower, War Hammer +3,
This hammer -- not to be confused with the elven-made Dwarf Thrower -- is only usable by dwarves.  In the capable hands of a dwarven warrior the hammer may be thrown at an opponent.  The magic in the hammer draws it back to the hand of its wielder.  If it hits an opponent it does double the normal damage that a hammer would normally do.  Against giants and ogres the hammer does an additional +8 damage, due to the special hatred that dwarves hold against these races.

@1039444 = ~Hammer of Thunderbolts

A dwarven smith, Silverblade, forged this hammer and two other items; a girdle of giant strength and a pair of gauntlets of ogre power.  His intention was to gift them to his son, who was then a high officer in the dwarven armies, fighting the giant and ogre tribes of the area.  Unfortunately Silverblade's son died just after the completion of the three items and before they could be gifted to him.  In grief Silverblade himself donned the girdle and the gauntlets.  Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts he went to battle against the giant folk.  He died valiantly.
Alone, the Hammer of Thunderbolts is a powerful magical weapon but when merged with the gauntlets of ogre power and the girdle of giant strength the hammer is transformed.  This transformation requires magical assistance.  The Hammer of Thunderbolts is then capable of doing an additional +8 damage as well as instantly killing any giant or ogre that it strikes.

Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge.

Beroalf was a barbarian who traveled from the cold north in search of adventure.  He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village.  Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage.  The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade.  Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless, and wielded the sword for many years.  How they were ultimately separated is not known.

In addition to strengthening the mind against the guile of others, the sword absorbs life energy from an opponent with each successful hit, healing the user.  Dabbar considered it a failure of his officers if he returned from battle in less than perfect health, and as the rest of the company watched, he would administer beatings until fully healed.

The ghost of Kullon himself attacked the intruder, but the flames that followed only singed, absorbed into the glowing Bloodbrand.  Concealing himself, Lehorgan watched in amazement as the ancient sorcerer tried to divine his location and again the sword protected him.  Surviving this brush with death, the young man used this second chance and the gold from selling the blade to, as he put it, "get the hell out of adventuring."

This blade belonged to Ho Mang, a traveler from Kara-Tur who accepted dubious service at courts throughout Faerun.  Skilled in "persuasion", he would use this sword to perform the "Death Of A Thousand Cuts", an ancient ritual from his homeland involving a lengthy series of small, painful incisions.

This sleek katana radiates magical energy when carried.  The Malakar, or 'Dueling Steel', was used by a less-than-honorable samurai during duels against other samurai.  As if of its own volition it will swoop down and deflect the slashing attacks of other weapons.  It is perfect for the warrior concerned about defense as well as offense.

The wakizashi, or companion sword, is extremely important to the samurai.  It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night.  Wu Jen masters have concealed within this wakizashi great power, unleashed only when the wielder is in the thick of battle.

This scimitar is of rather poor quality but beneath its surface lies great power and evil.  Created for the sole purpose of slaying Harpers, Shazzellim is more than capable of that task.  With one strike of the blade a bard must make a saving throw vs. spells or die.  Crafted by a Red Wizard of Thay, the sword also has the ability to vocalize, which is why it was often given to fighter-mages in the service of the Wizards.  Needless to say, possession of this sword would not be looked upon very highly by Harpers.

When the hero Trueblood destroyed the Harbinger, a demon gorging itself on the blood of peasant folk near Luskan, he bound its essence in the only vessel capable of holding it, his fabled sword, Deliverance.  Though the evil creature was dominated by the will of the semi-sentient blade, it was not truly defeated, and it transformed the weapon from within.  Now it acts much like any other enchanted weapon, but when it strikes, there is a small chance that a fireball erupts, a sign that the demon within still rages at its imprisonment.  There is also a chance that any ogre it hits will be turned to stone.  Whether this is an ability of the demon or a vestigial power of the original blade is not known.

A social faux pas placed upstart Andor Licon in a duel with Baron Eeirk, heir to a warrior king.  Though they seemed of even skill, Andor grew oddly weaker with each hit of the Baron's family blade.  Panicking, he bade his bodyguards kill Eeirk.  Despite his claims of morality, some noted that the young noble had positioned his men before the duel was even underway, and though he professed disdain for its dark magic, Andor made a tidy fortune off the sale of the evil blade.

Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.  Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

The title does not refer to the blade itself, but rather to the woman who originally wielded it in the icy hinterlands of Faerun.  Her name was Carerra, and she was a veritable firestorm that swept across arctic trolls and the northern orcish tribes.  She was a hated enemy of many a shaman whose magic often floundered against her fury. After a lifetime of raucous battle, it was old age that eventually claimed her.  The sword was passed to her granddaughter, an adventurer, who presumably brought it to Amn.

Bearpaw could draw back the bow without the slightest effort, but when he died it was bequeathed to his wife and sons, and not a one could draw the string even halfway.  They eventually sold it to a merchant heading South.

This yew bow is more a work of art than a weapon of war; fine engravings dance over the polished wood, and the bowstring gleams of gold, almost singing when drawn.  This was a ceremonial bow in the Elven Court for a thousand years, though that is scarcely a single lifetime in elven terms.  Every 50 years or so it was granted to someone who had performed a great service, the recipient eventually choosing who would hold it next.  Two centuries ago a human, Yin Pon, rescued an elven prince and was gifted the bow, which he carried with him to Baldur's Gate, where it was subsequently lost.

When anyone approached, down would fall a never-ending rain of phantom arrows until they were dead or fled.  How this bow was wrested from the Watcher's hand is not known, but would probably make a great tavern story.

Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect.

This throwing knife is imbued with magical fire, and was supposedly carved from an extracted red dragon tooth.

Yet when wielded and the command word 'Sleep' is intoned, the tiny dagger glows with a blue nimbus.  Upon striking an opponent the Pixie Prick releases a surge of powerful magic, potentially inducing a deep slumber.  Legends say that the ancient sprite knight, Alfonso de Noble wielded the Pixie Prick, not as a dagger but as a two-handed sword.

Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood", the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil.  Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, a feature that would fade if the staff were set aside.  He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him with a dozen hunting dogs or more.  The animals seemed ready to rip the poor druid to pieces, but he quickly turned them on their former masters.  Rushing forward in hopes of ending his influence, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.

There was a time when magic was distrusted even more so than now, and the burning of "heretics" was woefully common.  Delmarey, a witch from the swamplands near Myth Rynn, faced just such a fate when she was blamed for an unseasonable drought.  Taken by surprise and sentenced by a mob, she was put to the torch in the Village Square.  With her dying breath she uttered a foul curse, fueling the fire to an unstoppable magnitude.  By dawn, the entire village was reduced to black coal, save the burnt remnant of the pole Delmary had been bound to.  This staff has been imbued with some remnants of Delmarey's power, making it a highly enchanted weapon.

@1039637 = ~Girdle of Hill Giant Strength
This plain belt makes the wearer as strong as a hill giant, but does not make him or her giant size.  Many a cocky warrior has been surprised by a much smaller opponent with remarkable strength.  More often than not a belt such as this is the reason.

STATISTICS:

Strength: set to 19~
@1039638 = ~Girdle of Stone Giant Strength
As a young boy, Stewart Elttil was kidnapped by raiding kobolds after his family was slain.  However, en route to their den the kobolds surprised a family of stone giants.  These giants rescued Stewart and raised him as their own.  It soon became apparent that the boy, no matter how hard he tried, could not compete in the family rock-throwing contests.  The stone giant father bartered with a local wizard for this girdle, which made Stewart as strong as his brothers and sisters.  When Stewart met an untimely end, the girdle was stolen away.

STATISTICS:

Strength: set to 20~

This girdle greatly increases the wearer's constitution.  King Violos used it when leading an expedition against marsh trolls.  He'd been severely sickened the past winter and was no longer the healthy man he once was.

@1039641 = ~Belt of Inertial Barrier
When worn, this belt creates a dense curtain of air around the wearer.  This curtain, or barrier, provides superior protection against breath attacks as well as magic.  By the scorch marks on the worn leather, it is obvious that this belt has been worn at least once against a dragon.

 +5 to saves vs. breath weapons
 +25% Resistance to Missile Damage (Missile Attacks will do three quarters of full damage)
 +50% Resistance to Magic Damage (Magic Attacks (Such as Magic Missile, Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, etc.) will do half of full damage)~
@1039644 = ~Boots of Lightning Speed
These modified boots of speed were originally intended to boost the wearer's speed rating even more so than would normal boots of speed. When used, the wearer's movement rate increases as if under the effect of normal boots of speed combined with a haste spell. Unfortunately, the wearer cannot attack, and the strain of rushing around so fast quickly tires even the most stalwart of heroes. Their nick-name is 'Heel of the Coward,' for that summarizes their most obvious use: running away.

STATISTICS

Equipped Ability: Double-strength haste spell
Penalties: Unable to attack or cast spells~ []
@1039645 = ~Boots of Etherealness
Why these boots were ever made has long been the subject of speculation among the sages of Candlekeep.  Some suggest that a certain noblewoman was gifted them by an ethereal lover, so that she could join him for a tryst.  Others simply point out that the boots are useful for any mage to become intangible to attacks while devastating an opponent with offensive magic.

STATISTICS:

Use Abilities:
Etherealness: These boots can make a wearer ethereal for 30 seconds (once per day).  This makes the wearer immune to normal weapons.  Spells may still be cast, and weapons may still be used.~
@1039646 = ~Cloak of Elvenkind
This green cloak resembles a normal cloak.  Wearing it makes any person able to hide in shadows with astonishing ability.  As per the thief ability though, the moment the wearer attacks or otherwise makes his/her presence known the wearer must leave the shadows.

STATISTICS:

Hide in Shadows: bonus 50%~
@1039647 = ~Cloak of the Stars
Thalanta the Fair created many types of cloaks, all known as Cloaks of the Stars.  This particular version is simple, with three stars down each sleeve.  Once per day each star can be removed and thrown as a dart.  The star disappears, only to return the next day.

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities: Creates six +5 darts each day~
@1039648 = ~Cloak of the Sewers
For a sewer dweller like Ivan, survival meant going where others refused.  Hiding from thugs, Ivan went so deep into the sewers beneath Baldur's Gate, that he found caverns of natural caves, some of which opened to the ocean.  Within one cave, Ivan discovered what he thought was a ruined cloak, all torn and stained.  He tossed it into the fire he started, but it would not burn.  Curious, he donned it and with some prying he discovered its hidden abilities.  With the right command he could shift into a rat, a troll, or a mustard jelly.

STATISTICS:

AC: +1 bonus
Special Abilities: 
 Polymorph self: Once a day, the wearer can change into a rat, a troll,  or a mustard jelly.~

This robe was created by your apprentices, working busily away within the Planar Sphere.

STATISTICS:

AC: 3~
@1039654 = ~Golden Lion Figurine
This small figurine is a perfect replication, in miniature, of a lion.  When the command word is spoken, the lion grows to normal proportions, becoming a living, breathing giant cat.  The lion obeys the summoner's commands.  The lion remains for five minutes, or until slain, at which point it once again becomes a figurine.

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities:  Summons a lion for five minutes, once each day~
@1039656 = ~Black Spider Figurine

This black spider figurine fits in the palm of your hand.  When the command word is spoken the figurine comes to life as a semi-intelligent spider called Kitthix.  The spider will obey its master's commands for the duration of the spell or until slain.  After five minutes, regardless of whether the spider lived or died, the figurine returns.  It takes a day to recharge the figurine.

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities: Summons a huge spider for five minutes, once each day. The spider can Phase during combat. Kitthix can also use its Web Tangle ability, which sprays a stream of webbing at one target. If the target fails its save, it will be held by the webbing for 2 rounds. Kitthix's melee attack is poisonous.~
@1039658 = ~Horn of Blasting

While many army engineers spent their time perfecting siege equipment, Julius Baggar delved into magical tomes for his engineering insights.  Therein he found ancient scriptures that detailed how to make, control, and wield sound waves.  The Horn of Blasting was his first and only attempt at taking the theoretical magical knowledge to create a practical new technology.  An apprentice blew through the Horn, aimed in the direction of Julius who insisted on a 'useful experiment'.  The resulting shockwave that emanated from the horn, first stunned and then tore poor Julius apart.

This horn will summon forth a ninth-level berserk warrior who will fight for the summoner for one minute. The horn may be used once per day.~
@1039665 = ~Horn of Silence

When this odd horn is blown no sound issues forth, making most people discard it as being useless.  However if the proper command word is known the horn is capable of silencing all within the area of effect, providing that they fail a saving throw versus breath weapons.  This horn may be used three times a day.  The most common use of the Horn of Silence is as a weapon against mages.  Fighters often employ the horn, silencing enemy mages and drastically improving their own chances of success against the frail magic users.

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities: Silence everyone in area (unless they make a saving throw vs. breath weapon) for one minute~
@1039669 = ~Harp of Discord
Even the most talented bard cannot get this harp to play in tune.  Each stroke of the harp's strings results in a harsh, off-key note.  If the bard attempts to play a proper ballad upon the harp, its magical effects are released.  All creatures, other than the bard and his/her party, must make a saving throw vs. spells or be confused for thirty seconds.

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities:  3 times a day can cause confusion to all creatures within listening range (save vs. spells to avoid the confusion).  The bard and fellow party members are not affected by the confusion.

Usable By:

@1039671 = ~Azlaer's Harp
In the twisted court of Azlaer a bizarre ritual was enacted every night of the full moon.  Within Azlaer's massive palace lay a courtyard open to the sky above.  This courtyard housed a large pool full of man-eating sharks.  For amusement Azlaer would invite well-known citizens from nearby towns to his estate for an evening of dining and entertainment.
This entertainment consisted of Azlaer playing this harp, the effects of which removed any fear from his guests.  Randomly Azlaer would single out a guest and have him or her walk into the shark-filled pool.  When in a particularly sadistic mood Azlaer would first toss in blood, inciting the sharks into a frenzy that ended with the death of the helpless guest.
Devotees of Helm finally lashed out against Azlaer and his cruel practices, destroying the estate, slaying Azlaer and appropriating the harp for more beneficial uses.

@1039672 = ~Methild's Harp
In a valley far from most civilized lands there once was a tiny kingdom called Chilldion.  One winter evening a trio of evil witches overtook the valley and imprisoned the royal family by casting spells of holding upon them.  The witches planned to eat the family one by one.  Later that evening, the witches were exhausted after a hard day of slaying innocents and desecrating the palace, so they called for the court bard to play them a song.  Methild the bard was loyal to his king and the king's family and so he used the special powers of his magic harp.
As he played he focussed his attention first on the king.  As the song played on, the spell of holding upon the king dissipated, and the noble liege slowly crept away.  One by one Methild freed his patrons, being careful to keep the witches attention drawn his way.  Finally, once all the family was free, the bard could play no longer and the witches saw his treachery.  Poor Methild, unlike his lieges, did not escape and was served on the supper table in their place. 

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities:  Three times a day the harp can dispel hold-like effects on a single target.

@1039679 = ~Long sword +2:  Dragonslayer (Peridan)
Few dare to create items such as this, for who does not fear the wrath of dragons, and what action would more tempt their reckoning?  Yet, at a time lost in Faerun's past, there was a need, and this sword was forged in answer.  Tempered by a wizard's skill, this blade protects the wielder from the fear they should rightly feel while staring down a dragon's maw.  It also bolsters with regeneration, dispels the trickery of illusions, and dares to do double damage against the greatest creatures of the Realms.

@1039714 = ~Cloak of Reflection
Vorn Druidslayer crafted this cloak and used it with great success in his campaign to eliminate the druids from all the woods south of Baldur's Gate.  His campaign ended abruptly when he encountered a flock of wyverns, who were attracted by the cloak's sheen. They killed Vorn and used the cloak to cover their nest, serving to protect their young during electrical storms.

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities: Reflects all electrical damage back to the source~
@1039716 = ~Cloak of Mirroring
Though it feels much like normal cloth, this shimmering cloak has on occasion been described as "woven water".  Its true enchantment becomes apparent when the wearer is attacked directly by magic, and all damage caused by spell effects is returned to the caster.

STATISTICS:

Special Abilities:  Reflects all spell damage back to the source.  This includes offensive spells like magic missile, but not disabling (non-damage) spells such as hold person.~
@1039751 = ~You have our thanks for destroying our collars. If you are in search of the newest captives, you can find them in the northwest part of the complex. Perhaps they will have a way to save us from this forsaken prison.~
@1039763 = ~If that is what you wish... it will be safer than waiting here. I will wait outside by the palisade.~ [NALIA95]
@1039764 = ~Boots of Elvenkind
These soft boots make the wearer move as silently as the woodland elves.  Thieves love to get their hands on these boots, but the elves are reluctant about exporting them, fearful that they may be used for illegal purposes.

@1039955 = ~Ring of Spell Turning
A gift to Derek Poodon, apprentice warrior, this ring was his salvation when he stumbled upon two Red Wizards traveling the Cloakwood Forest.  Enraged at being disturbed, the mages unleashed a score of Magic Missiles at the seemingly helpless Derek, but to their brief surprise, the assault reflected back and killed them both.  Thereafter, without having lifted his blade, Derek was rather sheepishly known as Derek the Red Slayer.

@1040104 = ~Incensed at your decisions, a crowd of angry peasants has stormed the gates of the keep, let in by mutinous guardsmen that also thought you abused your power as ruler of the land and manor.
As cries of rage traveled the halls you were forced to reluctantly escape through a side passage... even with your skills, a crowd of both peasants and guardsmen could not have been held off for long.

By the time you left the keep, the gentlefolk of the land had taken control of the building... likely waiting for knights from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart or even a new lord to come from nearby. Either way, rule of the de'Arnise Keep has been stripped from you... permanently.~

@1040545 = ~This journal seems to be that of an apprentice mage, telling the tale of her expedition into the Umar Hills with two other apprentices in the search for evidence of the fabled witch. The tale is hard to believe, but seems to relate the group's horror at getting lost and being hounded by an unseen predator during the nights. The script is in a panicky, feminine hand and the last page can barely be made out as follows:

"... sorry to Joshellus' mother. I'm sorry about what happened to Michaelus. There's something out here with us. We thought it to be peasants but peasants aren't this clever. Joshellus says it's the witch. I hear her when I sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want..."

The journal ends here.~
@1040634 = ~This Figurine of Wondrous Power calls forth from the ether the moon dog Cerebus. Cerebus will obey the owner of the figurine if he so chooses.

Cerebus may be summoned once per day, for five minutes, and has the following innate powers:
Moon Dog Howl: used once per summoning, the howl damages and instills fear in enemies who are evil, while also dispelling fear and casting Protection from Evil on party members.
Healing Lick: heals 20 HP of damage and cures Disease, Deafness, Blindness and Poison.

@1040641 = ~The tome is a mishmash of ideas, sketches and scribbles. One section on Iron Golem Creation draws your eye:

"I am sick to the stomach with travelling the planes! Nearly every place I stop I manage to pick up some dangerous passenger that dents my guardian here when he goes to throw them out. Don't these demons and their ilk realize that iron golems are tedious to maintain? Regardless, he's nearly fixed now. If I can only remember where I've placed the arm and the head. I haven't really been feeling like myself lately. It's probably nothing.

Note to self: once the other two golem parts are found, REMEMBER to START the FURNACE. Get some damned coal! Recall the unfortunate week spent dodging the balor whilst agonizing over why the cursed activation machine wouldn't run!"

The tome continues for a few more pages although the writing makes less and less sense. Lavok seems to have been going mad.~

This amulet bears the signature enchantments of Conster Damon, an archmage that fell in the Year of the Dracorage (1018DR).  The crispness of its etchings may have faded with fire and time, but it still echoes his famous defiant cries: "Your magic denied!" "I will be heard!" "Defeat comes swiftly!" "Take nothing from me!" It has seen much use, and changed hands many times through blood and battle.

Most who take up the trade of murder for hire do so for reasons other than personal pleasure, but not so the Lady Demarche.  She took special pleasure in the torture of her targets...which is why she made this dagger.  With but one touch of its polished blade an opponent was rendered immobile, incapable of so much as screaming, yet the victim could watch and feel all that happened to them.  While her opponent was thus held, the Lady would slowly bleed them, sometimes taking several hours before allowing her subject to succumb to the final agony of death.  The Lady finally fell victim to her own evil; disarmed by a rival and struck by her own Stiletto her fate was soon sealed.

Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Sight of the caster
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell is only available to Harpers.  The Harper's Call restores a comrade to life, to further service the cause of the Harpers.  This spell functions similar to Raise Dead, with the following exceptions.  The Harper must transfer a small portion of her life essence (10 hit points) to successfully raise the deceased person.  In addition, the person has but 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.  Lastly, the raised person suffers a -5 penalty to all ability scores for one minute, making this spell virtually useless in combat.~

@1044943 = ~Iron Skins (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a druid casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground, completely covering her.  This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every two levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting.  For example, a 10th-level druid would receive 5 skins.  For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him but the sixth would affect her normally.  The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks such as fireball.~

@1045867 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

Monks must be of Lawful alignments.

Advantages:
-  The monk can make 1 unarmed attack per round, and gains 1/2 an additional attack every 3 levels to a maximum of 4 attacks per round at level 18.
-  The damage inflicted by the monk's fists goes up as as the monk increases in levels:
Level 1-2:  1-6
Level 3-5:  1-8
Level 6-8:  1-10
Level 9-14:  1-12
Level 15+: 1-20
-  A monk's natural armor class gets better as the monk goes up in levels. Armor class starts off at 9, and then decreases by 1 for every 2 levels until level 21, then every 3 levels until 30, then every 5 levels until 40.
-  Stunning blow, once per day for every 4 levels. All attacks in the next 6 seconds force the victim to save or be stunned. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  Monks have the Deflect Missiles ability. This gives them a -1 to their AC vs missiles for every 3 levels.
-  The monk gains a +2 to save vs spells
-  A monk starts off moving at +2 move, then +1 move every 5 levels.
-  5th level:  Immunity to all diseases, and cannot be Slowed or Hasted.
-  7th level:  Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level
-  8th level:  -1 to speed factor
-  9th level:  +1 to all saves. Immune to charm. The monk's fist is considered a +1 weapon (+2 at 12th, +3 at 15th)
-  11th level:  Immune to poison
-  12th level:  Another -1 to speed factor.  Fists are considered +2 weapons. 
-  13th level:  Quivering palm spell once per day. This spell gives one hand attack. If an opponent is struck, the opponent must Save Vs. Death or die. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  14th level:  The monk gains 3% innate magic resistance per level (starting a 42% at 14th level, and reaching a maximum of 78%)
-  15th level:  Fists are considered +3 weapons
-  20th level:  Immune to non-magical weapons

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear any armor
-  May not use the off-hand in combat, so may only use one-handed weapons available to the thief class, may not carry a shield, and may not dual-wield (use a second melee weapon.)~ []

@1046918 = ~Perhaps your idea is not so ludicrous after all. I have found some suspicious paraphernalia in Barl's chambers. An alchemy set and a symbol of Talona, the Mistress of Poison.~
@1046924 = ~But enter them I did, Barl. I found alchemists' poisons, bottles and a holy symbol of Talona. You have betrayed Waukeen.~
@1046945 = ~Alas, my friend. I'm afraid I have no wares to show you, the cursed genies have taken over all of Trademeet's mercantile enterprises. Perhaps another time.~
@1047016 = ~The Shade Lord's destruction was my party's intention. We were hired by Minister Lloyd of Imnesvale.  Alas, the Shadow Dragon guardian has slain all of my friends. ~
@1047030 = ~We'll keep on supplying the town, now... at least, until the Sythillisian Empire comes and invades the entire region. But at least there's a chance.~

@1047124 = ~This is a simple stuffed children's bear. It depicts the mischievous Littleman from halfling legend.~

@1047159 = ~A golden circlet found within the sealed tomb in Trademeet's cemetery. The circlet is tarnished with age but one can still make out Waukeen's symbol on the circlet.~
@1047209 = ~That is more of a question than you know, child. Suffice it to say that a tiny rivvil like yourself would not wish to meet more of my kind.~
@1047262 = ~Thirty feet high he was, with a wingspan easily three times that! Red as blood and eviler than a cockatrice in May!~
@1047263 = ~I slew the beast, naturally, after a valiant struggle.  A few minor scorch-marks were all I suffered for felling the beast, and its hoard was mine!  More gold than you could possibly imagine!~
@1047361 = ~Don't look at me like that. I want to work here. In Trademeet, all employees are treated fairly... that's Waukeen's rule: fair trade. It's good coin for an independent woman, you know.~
@1047382 = ~I would be careful with that sharp tone, rivvil, lest you lose the tongue that shapes it. Fortunately, I've no particular need of your slophouse and its stench of sweat.~
@1047393 = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've heard it all before.  Human, elf, dwarf... ye're all the same.  Walkin' about with a swagger like ye own the place and nary a brain to be found except what's twixt yer legs.~
@1047401 = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I heard it all before.  Just because ye're an elf, ye thinks all that prancin' around in the forest an' singings makes ye a better man?  Well, I think ye're dirt.  An' not in the good sense.~
@1047434 = ~Papa!  Papa!  Smelly is threatening me again, he is!  Threatening!~
@1047451 = ~Of all the bloody insults hurled at me, this be the blackest!  Ye're a traitorous, backstabbing liar, Korgan... after a double-cross like yours, I be surprised ye've nay fled for the hills!~

It grants the wearer exceptional protection against many different kinds of attacks. They are not attuned to any particular person, but you would be hard pressed to find someone that would lend such an item or even let it out of their sight. It is quite literally a badge of honor.

@1047545 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

I have killed Mae'Var, although I did it without the evidence that Renal needed and without his approval. Even though I got the job done, Renal was not pleased with my performance.~
@1047578 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

While I was not able to catch Rejiek Hidesman, I have at least stopped his reign of terror in Athkatla and sent him fleeing. The matter of Lieutenant Aegisfield, the guard who I inadvertently sent to his death, has also been dealt with. I wonder if this ends, now, or if I will meet this disgusting murderer once again.~
@1047721 = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

I managed to secure the services of the artist, Sir Sarles, for the church... although it was certainly not easy. He had demanded to use pure illithium, which I had to obtain from a murderous gnome named Neb. Still, the task is done.~
@1047760 = ~I make you weak at the worst of all times, but in the end I keep you safe. You'll sweat in my presence even as you grow cold. I dwell with the weak, rarely the brave, but without me, who could tell the difference?~

@1047919 = ~Far too dismissive. You show inflexibility. Not desirable. The path will be harder still.~
@1047950 = ~The path is made easier, though not totally without hazard.~
@1047959 = ~Then we shall proceed to your evaluation.~
@1047986 = ~The Harper plot revealed.

The plot with the Harpers has finally come clear...Galvarey was not a true Harper at all, simply an opportunist who used his position to gain power.  Jaheira's former mentor was one of his compatriots, and both were counting on the fact that my own status as a child of Bhaal would make any accusations made against me believable.

One must wonder if the rest of the Harpers will continue their vendetta against Jaheira and I.~
@1047987 = ~Free Jan Jansen from prison.

Well, Jan Jansen's fine has been paid to the jailkeep... who was eager enough to see the garrulous gnome leave that he lent me 200 gp. He does expect to be paid back, though. I suppose the only thing to do now is to tell Jan he's free.~
@1047988 = ~Free Jan Jansen from prison.

The jailkeep who lent me the 200 gp toward Jan's fine has been paid back.~
@1047991 = ~Jan Jansen returns to his home in the slums.

I managed to get a garrulous con-artist gnome out of a jam with the local authorities, and he has offered to join my party in the future should I wish to track him down at his home in the slums. Selling turnips, he said... but somehow I doubt that.~
@1048013 = ~Keldorn dies defending Sir William.

Keldorn's odd sense of justice and honor forced him to defend Sir William, the very man whom his own wife has been betraying him with.  Now, the Lady Maria is not only an adulteress, but a widow as well.~

@1048163 = ~He is dead. You and Ason should go to see Calahan immediately. He will put you on the next ship to Ulgoth's Beard.~
@1048194 = ~Darnta be a fool. This here town is owned by pirates. Ye wouldn't be here unless ye're foolish or a criminal in yer own right. When in Thesk, do as the Theskians do an' all dat.~
@1048233 = ~Then we be agree'n. Their passage is assured if ye can get them away from that bastard Chremy. Send 'em to ol' Calahan when ye've got things arranged.~

@1048471 = ~That's probably not something you want to think about too closely, Aerie.  Some parts of the world are very ugly places and more often than not the journey to them is a short one.~
@1048472 = ~Aye, lass. It is a terrible thing to ponder. But have we not done our part in ending this base tyranny? Cling to that, if you can.~
@1048473 = ~Grow up, girl!  Must we endure your mewling every time you confront human nature? (Hmm, I have to wonder what she'll be like in twenty years.  Maybe with my help...)~
@1048492 = ~Now ye're going to be hanging on every word that tree-hugging, flower-eating half-elf be saying?  Bah!  Ye're a yellow kobold, ye are.~
@1048529 = ~Well... I've heard of this Lord Jierdan, <CHARNAME>, if it's any help.  He has the coin to back up his offer.  He's not reputed to be the nicest noble in Amn, but then who is?~
@1048533 = ~I... I don't know, Jaheira, I've heard about this Lord Jierdan.  He's brutal; it's not like him to be so protective of his people.  I don't like the sound of this.~
@1048586 = ~For once I agree with the addled ranger.  I dislike being manipulated and would be interested in Lord Jierdan's reasons, though I care nothing about a rescue.~
@1048633 = ~Ooo, there's none so desirable a trinket as one you cannot see. Are you sure I can't just have a peek or two?~
@1048635 = ~I am not certain I would find your wares palatable regardless. I suspect they are ill-got in origin.~
@1048646 = ~Ye're a weak stick of a lad then. It comes natural to better men than you.~
@1048652 = ~No doubt you are deserving of your punishment, though this place is probably far emptier than it should be...~

@1048779 = ~Calm yourself, rivvil.  I intend no harm to any of you, lest you strike the first blow.  Then things will get bloodier than you will like, I assure you.~
@1048786 = ~Samuel... Samuel Thunderburp. Greatest fighter of Highdale and renowned rapscallion. Yes, indeed, it has been a long time.~
@1048791 = ~That's good. Well, I have you to thank, <CHARNAME>, for saving my favorite halfling paladin. Here, a pair of my old adventuring boots. More use to you than I.~
@1048821 = ~Raising... raising babies?  I... I just started seeing something of the world beyond the circus.  One step at a time is good enough for me!~

@1048884 = ~I do not support this Vittorio's actions, but I cannot stand by and watch him hurt. If we do not look for this... this gong... then we must stop the Captain from exacting vengeance.~

The life of a drunkard lies in the balance as <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> band of merry adventurers strive to retrieve fenced stolen musical goods from the depths of the sewers!  The passion!  The excitement!  It brings a tear to my eye.  (sniff!)  Not since Uncle Gerhardt went on a four-day turnip-beer bender and mistook Uncle Scratchy for a griffon was I ever part of such a grandiose story.~

@1049228 = ~The deeper you get within the keep, the more trolls and yuan-ti you'll find. Open the bridge and we will engage them. It may be your only chance.~ []

@1049323 = ~I am not here to address you, heartless Harper wench.  I am here to appeal to your erstwhile companion, <CHARNAME>.~
@1049338 = ~Very well. Go to Garren Windspear and find the Deed to the Windspear Hills. I care not whether he lives or dies. Conster! Go and take care of the child. They are no longer needed. <CHARNAME>, return when you have the deed.~
@1049353 = ~The Harpers aren't likely to tell us what happened to his spy willingly... but they might answer some questions since we, ah, helped with that other man.~ []
@1049382 = ~Fools! The Master will brook no incompetence! You are to clean his favorite golems and you do work too poorly! The Master is furious! He values his golems more than a hundred of you!!~
@1049445 = ~No, you have been usurped from within. Not all in my care were there completely against their will. Yoshimo has certainly proven his worth, with some encouragement.~

@1049988 = ~You are ignorant, even for a human. Fortunately for you, Arvoreen calls for patience for such as you, or I would strike you down where you stand for such blasphemy.~
@1049992 = ~Calm yourself, rivvil. Or slice your own throat upon your knife, I truly do not care. The amount of hysteria your kind experiences by my mere presence is laughable.~
@1050024 = ~It's nothing, Aerie, I will be fine. Do not worry yourself.~

@1050251 = ~Mmm-hmm. Very convincing, Vicky. Next thing you know, she'll be administering to the sick and setting up a program for disenchanted prostitutes. "Oh, dear," we'll moan, "whatever happened to our wicked little Vicky?" ... ehhh... or maybe not.~
@1050267 = ~Nevertheless, I insist that I receive the deed before you open the portal.~
@1050269 = ~If that is how it must be. Here, take the deed and prepare yourself.~
@1050307 = ~And he hasn't changed since ye bathed him, woman.  He still whines, cries, throws 'is tantrums and belches after every meal.~
@1050317 = ~I merely thought you would be interested in recent events. A trespasser that got his due from someone he crossed.~
@1050393 = ~I can stay here and begin preparatory spells, but I cannot cast the actual dimension-breaching spells without the procedures outlined in my book of rituals.~
@1050418 = ~It will be worth it in the end, I promise. I would not venture into this place if I did not think it warranted the risk. If you can help, please do.~
@1050423 = ~You see, I anticipated something like this. I have made myself indispensable to the project. I will compensate you fairly, I assure you. ~
@1050427 = ~Then we are at an impasse that can only be solved with violence. I am sorry that it came to this yet again. Raise your weapons, I have no choice!~
@1050470 = ~Still, if you are so insistent I suppose that I could up your reward a bit more, though I reserve the right to take the majority for myself.~
@1050472 = ~That is sufficient. I thank you for your generosity.~
@1050524 = ~Why does my own mind ask the length of its stay? Do I taunt myself now? Trapped I am, and this is naught but a figment! A dream!~
@1050529 = ~You are confused... perhaps mad. Calm yourself or you will come to harm.~
@1050535 = ~I'm glad to hear it. The fact of the matter is, Logan's lily-footing ways will fail. I wonder if the fool even wants to stop the mad druids!~
@1050583 = ~And what is your place? To stand at the fore and fling accusations? I have survived more self-righteous rivvin than you, and done far less harm!~
@1050586 = ~I can survive, addled one. I was taken by surprise today, but I have been among rivvin secretly for quite some time. But neither do I object to traveling with you.~
@1050657 = ~You turn a page in the ancient tome, and a magic portal suddenly opens, spawning a blood-thirsty monster!~
@1050679 = ~A wise tactic to split an opponent's force with magic. Your kind are tricky adversaries, Drow. I will not fall victim to the same again.~
@1050694 = ~Hmph. I misjudged you, coward. Run along then and play by Logan's lily-livered rules. When I come to power you shall no longer be welcome in Trademeet.~
@1050730 = ~Knowledge is the key to safety. I learned that quick, I did. To the East, you'll find a group of Kuo-Toans guarding a bridge.  A nasty lot, they are.~
@1050731 = ~I must try to find my way out and discover what happened to my own group. I wish you well.~

@1051951 = ~Jansen AdventureWear~ []
@1051952 = ~Jansen-Brand Metal-Repellant AdventureWear - (patent pending)

This strange armor is made of a foreign material, very supple but strong to the touch.  Designed by and for Jan Jansen, only he may wear it.  The armor does not give any bonuses to the base armor class, but it does grant a +25% resistance to all physical damage and an additional +5 bonus to Jan's armor class against missile weapons.  Jan may also cast spells while wearing this armor. In addition, the armor is stylish.

@1051954 = ~Jansen-Brand Micro-Macro Spectroscopes - (Official Spectroscopes of the Purple Brotherhood)

Another one of Jan Jansen's inventions, these glasses allow Jan to detect invisibility once per day.  They also give Jan an additional +25% to his detect and disarm traps abilities. Various lenses on the contraption increase Jan's ability to detect illusions by 20%. The style of the Spectroscopes is so obvious it hardly needs to be mentioned.

@1051957 = ~Jansen-Brand Techno-Thieving Gadgetizer Gloves - (TM)

This set of thieving tools gives Jan an additional bonus to both his lock picking and pickpocketing.  He is the only one who can use the Gloves, as no one else quite has the knack of it. Oddly, he seems to be able to actually cast spells while wearing the things.  Must be because they got style.

Lockpicking: +20%
Pick Pockets: +20%~

@1054892 = ~WILD MAGE: Wild magic is a new type of magic that is characterized by powerful and dangerous surges or unpredictable magic. Generally considered to be an unfortunate byproduct of the Time of Troubles, wild magic has recently begun to attract the attention of many a curious or scholarly wizard.

A Wild Mage is a wizard that specializes in the study of wild magic and has access to spells to protect him/herself from Wild Magic since, every time the mage casts a spell, there's a 5% chance of a random wild magic effect happening.  Wild magic is extremely unpredictable and should be used with caution.~

Flydian at the City Gates was soliciting help for Trademeet. It's under an animal-based siege where Druids are suspected. I told him I wasn't interested at this time~
@1054925 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Met with militia.

The Trademeet Militia Captain was relieved that I wished to help stop the attacks the town has suffered. She directed me to High Merchant Lord Logan Coprith. She warned that the scared townsfolk are suspicious of outsiders, especially Druids.~
@1054926 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Unnecessary violence.

I have fought the Militia Captain in Trademeet. I don't know the nature of the animal attacks they have been suffering, or if their suspicions against druids are justified, but this battle will certainly not help the situation.~

The spells stored in the sequencer are cast as any other spell and can be accessed through the special abilities button on the main screen. It is important to note that when you choose the spells to be stored in the trigger, they will disappear from the ones you have memorized. However, the trigger will last until used so the caster may rest and gain those spells back. The main use for this spell would be to allow the caster to release multiple spells upon a target very quickly in combat without the possibility of being interrupted.~

Baron Metrich wishes a number of squatters removed, and has cited recent violence against his men as just cause for such action. I must go to the neutral meeting place, a tavern in the Umar Hills, in the village of Imnesvale. I must restore order and bring favor on our name.~
@1055556 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A moral victory.

Tyrianna is alive and well, thanks to me being able to detect the evil that was about to be perpetrated. The real Hurgis collected her as he said he would, confirming my suspicion that a fake Hurgis had been sent in his place to begin with. I have now been given leave to pursue my own goals. The Order will contact me if further service is required.~

I have advised Glinden that he should ignore his wife's infidelity. His marriage will continue despite this simple indiscretion.~

I have advised Glinden that he should remind his wife of her duty to their vows. She will understand that duty is all-important.~
@1055577 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was well served.

Stressing self-sacrifice for the love of another was in the true spirit of the teachings of Lathander, and Glinden and his wife have benefitted. I have served the church well.~
@1055578 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was not served.

I have not done well in the eyes of Lathander. I should have stressed that Glinden adopt a more self-sacrificing love for his wife. Instead, they are unhappy and church doctrine is unsatisfied.~
@1055580 = ~The prophecy of Sekolah

Taken down into a city far below the ocean surface by the Sahuagin, I was greeted by a High Priestess of the shark god Sekolah and told that I was intended for some higher purpose that Sekolah had foretold.  Not one to be used, I refused their 'hospitality'... I would rather fight my way back to the surface, if need be.~
@1055603 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is not pleased.

I was too lenient on Rania and her weakened faith. Duty should have been better stressed. If she could not stand up to such, she is not worthy of Helm.~
@1055629 = ~Mage Stronghold: Ambush!

Teos had not summoned me to the sphere. It was an ambush to get us both. We were attacked by a strange assailant. He screamed about the 'glory of Argrim.'~
@1055630 = ~Mage Stronghold: Fanatic assassination.

Teos has given me a new task. I am to dispatch one Lord Ketlaar Argrim. He is an anti-magic fanatic, and wants us all confined or killed. I am to use a special rune of imprisonment on him so that he will not be a martyr. He will simply disappear.  Ketlaar can be found at the Crooked Crane near the city gates.~
@1055631 = ~Mage Stronghold: No more.

I have refused to be the lackey of Teos and the Cowled Wizards. I turned down their request to battle Lord Ketlaar Argrim. As a result I have been restricted from entering the Planar Sphere again. It is no longer open to me. A pity.~
@1055632 = ~Mage Stronghold: Free at last.

I have been released from service to the Cowled Wizards. I did as they asked to the best of my ability, facing off against Lord Ketlaar and whatnot, so now I have unfettered use of the Planar Sphere. A painfully obvious base of operations, but it will have to do.~
@1055633 = ~Mage Stronghold: Apprentice crap.

Apparently those apprentices that were dumped on me were supposed to take instruction and make what I directed. I have no time to care, so I just cut them loose. Let's see what they can do on their own. Might be a bit dangerous, but they have to learn sometime, right?~

Uncle Chester Bellowsbreath was like that too, talking himself so big that you'd swear he was ten feet tall, which was not too far off considering he had a strange disorder stemming from an obscenity hurled at a passing wizard one drunken eve in Waterdeep. Stomp and pomp all ye wish, but it would do you well to take the simple advice of never telling Khelben Blackstaff to "put a shine on that thing and stop being so darned pompous with yer dark-cornered mysteriosity," and if you do, don't punctuate it with a rotten turnip at high velocity.~
@1055843 = ~Negative Plane Protection (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell confers upon the target partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as vampires), as well as from certain weapons and spells which drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy plane, offsetting the effects of a negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is shielded against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell, suffering only normal hit point damage. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy plane.~ []
@1055845 = ~Lesser Restoration (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Sphere:  Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the life-energy level of the recipient is raised.  This reverses any previous life-energy-level drain of the creature by a force or monster.  The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest and she will likely require rest immediately after the casting, as it will cause days worth of fatigue almost instantaneously.~

A Duergar in the Underdark said a mage was trapped by the Imprisonment spell in a battle. He wanted to unearth a treasure trove or artifact of some kind, but was attacked.

One night he made a particularly strong batch of brew that, for reasons that will become clear in a moment, he was destined to call 'Old One-Eye,'43'. I tell you, he got so involved in the tasting that he fell into the keg up to his ankles the wrong way around, and had to breathe through the spigot for three hours lest he drown in a watery tomb of his own making. Helpful Aunt Tildeberry came in later for a late night snifter and tried to unclog the spout with a hairpin, and you can imagine the fuss that emerged from that mess. An inch or two off-target and the mixture would have been the much less ominous 'Poke in the Nose, '43', but that's neither here nor there.~

@1057864 = ~Captured by Mind Flayers!

I could trust the Githyanki, but only to a point. Simyaz and his group are leaving me to fend for myself, and I will have to find my own means of escape. They left after again chastising me for the theft of their Silver Sword, the weapon I got from Saemon Havarian. Lacking the teleportational abilities of the Githyanki I could not follow when they left, and must now face the wrath of the illithid city on my own.~
@1057881 = ~Very good. Her home is to the southwest. I shall see you at the ship. Remember, all must happen after dark, but quickly. The Pirate Lord is not the only threat that haunts us.~

This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead.  Any such creature hit by it not only feels the sting of weapon, but also has a chance of being simply blasted from existence.  There are legends that speak of a priest so holy a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.
Now that the mace has been coated with illithium, it is even more potent, conferring to its user immunity to the life-draining powers of the more powerful undead.

I have discovered that Aran's inner sanctum is protected by two magical doors. They can be neither picked nor bashed. The first requires a button, the second, a key.

The button can be found somewhere to the north, at the end of a heavily trapped hallway.

@1063220 = ~Dragon's Breath
(Any School)
Level: 10
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw:  Special

This spell causes a disembodied head of a red dragon to appear and breathe fire with the strength of an adult red dragon. In addition to the enormous 20D10 fireball, the force of the dragon's breath knocks an opponent off their feet and away from the caster. The victim can save vs. breath to take half damage and not be blown backwards.

This spell will not harm party members.~

@1063573 = ~You step over the blood-soaked corpse of the canine who attacked you earlier. The room smells of wet dog.~
@1063586 = ~As you enter this well-furnished room, a spectral figure in rotting rags materializes near the far wall. It points an emaciated, crooked finger in your direction and glides towards you.~
@1063616 = ~Energy Blades
(Any School)
Level: 10
Range: Special
Duration: 4 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

An energy blade is a discus made of pure energy. The disc gives +10 to THAC0 and, when thrown, does 1D4+5 missile damage as well as 1D10 additional electrical damage. This spell creates 1 energy disc per level of the caster and sets the caster's attacks to 9 as long as the discs are held.~
@1063622 = ~A rabid gibberling rushes from the shadows to attack you, its small body a mere blur of fur and teeth. It moves with such furious speed that retreat is not an option.~
@1063639 = ~Using the iron key you found earlier, you unlock the lid of the chest.  Inside is a blue potion.  Instinctively, the body of the spirit warrior seizes the potion and drinks it down, causing your wounds to heal greatly.~
@1063670 = ~It's rather simple, actually. We'll use the rules established by the renowned match between Tandem the Sensate and Bal'evoreth in Sigil.~
@1063700 = ~You turn and flee in terror, but not before the ghost brushes you with its bony finger, numbing your body with the chill touch of the grave.~
@1063736 = ~The Blood War

I have agreed to do a job for a tanar'ri balor named Tahazzar to find a baatezu pit fiend named Ka'rashur elsewhere in this maze and to destroy it... and then return to Tahazzar with its heart. He has promised me not only a material reward but also the goodwill of the tanar'ri.~
@1063743 = ~Storm of Vengeance 
Level: Quest
Range: 90 Yards
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special

Casting this spell causes the earth to shake and the heavens to boil with blood and energy. All enemies of the caster are struck down by acidic rain, earthquakes and lightning.

All enemies of 8th level or lower are slain instantly. The survivors are struck by acidic, poisonous rain and lightning. The storm lasts for 3 rounds. Each round, the victims suffer 1D6 electrical damage, 1D6 fire damage and 1D6 acid damage (Save vs. spells for half damage). They also have a chance to be poisoned (Save Vs. Death) in the first round.~
@1063807 = ~You are startled as the picture of a blazing, fiery rock seems to leap out at you from the card, its golden trail leading deep within the black background. The card is labeled 'COMET'.~
@1063831 = ~Summon Fallen Deva 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: Quest
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None

This spell opens an abyssal gate and calls forth a demonic deva to fight at the caster's side until the spell expires or the deva's earthly avatar is slain.~
@1063833 = ~Unlocking the Final Seal

By running the gauntlet, I have proved my perseverance, my courage and the wisdom of my heart. However, I suspect I must possess all three keys - heart, mind and spirit - before the Final Seal can be unlocked.~
@1064139 = ~This particular work is obviously much newer than any of the other volumes contained within the Temple Library.

History of the Imprisoned One:  

He also serves who stands and waits and watches carefully.

Such is the lesson of the Great Guard, Helm of the Unsleeping Eyes. 
Let the events of this forgotten temple serve as an example to all who would follow the Vigilant One. Beneath this hallowed earth the avatar of the Watcher confronted great evil, a Prince of the Underplanes. 

Through steadfast perseverance Helm, Guardian of the Gods, fulfilled his sacred duty and bound the creature in the bowels of the temple that it might walk the world no more.

Speak not the beast's name, ye Knights of the Vigil, but guard this place. Protect the wards which seal the Imprisoned One within, and remain ever watchful.

Never betray your trust - such is the will of Helm.

Regrettably, the old priest could not remember the Holy Passage to be read during today's service. His noble soul is willing, yet his aging mind fails him in his hour of need. Perhaps the discreet embroidering of the appropriate chapter and verse into the sleeve of his ceremonial robe will alleviate future embarrassments.

@1064192 = ~Bah!  I should spit in disgust every time I hear his name, but he's not worth the effort.  Gromnir Il-Khan's nothing but a bully - a cruel, cowardly little despot.~

@1064246 = ~Yaga-Shura's army will kill us all - we're doomed! With General Il-Khan alive we at least had a chance to fight!~
@1064255 = ~Oh, of course!  General Gromnir always makes a point of coming to me, personal-like, and sharing his secrets!~
@1064265 = ~You have saved us from the tyrant Gromnir. Please don't abandon us now! The army of Yaga-Shura will burn Saradush to the ground if you don't save us!~
@1064270 = ~Ye're just like that other Bhaalspawn - a bully pushin' us good folk around, wantin' us to fawn all over ye!  I ain't got nothin' more to say to you!~
@1064303 = ~Beyond the walls of Saradush awaits the army of Yaga-Shura. They have laid siege to this town, seeking the death of all those here who share your tainted blood.~
@1064304 = ~Yaga-Shura is a Bhaalspawn, <CHARNAME> - perhaps as powerful as you yourself. He and his army will not rest until every child of Bhaal within these walls lies dead.~
@1064305 = ~Until you prove yourself there are some secrets I must keep to guarantee the safety of the people I have sworn to protect. If you wish to save yourself from Yaga-Shura you will aid me, regardless.~
@1064367 = ~I like to know who my enemies are - could you tell me more about Yaga-Shura?~
@1064376 = ~Your own life is tied to the fate of Saradush, <CHARNAME>. If you do not help us now, the army of Yaga-Shura will destroy everyone within this town - including you.~
@1064377 = ~Why should I be so afraid of this Yaga-Shura?~
@1064379 = ~Why is Yaga-Shura so intent on destroying the Bhaalspawn?~
@1064410 = ~Why is Yaga-Shura killing all the other Bhaalspawn?~
@1064442 = ~I'll need a thousand gold to share this little secret.~ []
@1064481 = ~I am loath to re-open the entrance, lest the evil escape into the city. But if you think you can reason with Gromnir or aid the city somehow, perhaps it is worth the risk.~
@1064548 = ~Figured that out all on your own, did you?  While the thought of harboring a spark of your sugary-sweet soul for eternity does not exactly fill me with joy...yes, it would provide just as well.~
@1064559 = ~I have little to reward you with, but perhaps... perhaps you could go to Kiser's home and speak with him.  Maybe somehow you can convince him to release my son.~
@1064634 = ~When we began our investigations, I strongly suspected Kiser. He's a greedy, self-serving weasel who would sell his own mother if the price was right.~
@1064661 = ~Mind if I come to watch the traitor's execution?~
@1064840 = ~A farfetched tale. How do I know you are telling the truth?~

@1064972 = ~You murdered Errard to save me?  You would have been better off leaving me here to die!~
@1064998 = ~Saradush Under Siege

I find myself in the city of Saradush, surrounded by the army of Yaga-Shura - a Child of Bhaal. Within the city are a number of my own Bhaalspawn kin, led by a despot named Gromnir Il-Khan. It seems they cannot escape from the city (even by magical means) while the army is camped outside.
~
@1065000 = ~Saradush Under Siege

I have spoken with Melissan, a woman claiming to be a friend and protector of the Children of Bhaal. She has promised me an explanation of why Yaga-Shura wants to kill me and all the other Bhaalspawn here if I can end this siege.
~
@1065094 = ~Please, Gromnir. <CHARNAME> just wants to talk to you. It may be our only way to defeat Yaga-Shura.~
@1065265 = ~The tale begins to spin again! Ha ha! 'Tis a marvelous life, <CHARNAME>, do not convince yourself otherwise!~
@1065267 = ~Well, 'tis not quite so interesting to stand about in a miniature plane... but this sparrow is pleased enough to watch your tale from afar, for now.~
@1065272 = ~As you wish, my friend. 'Tis a quiet enough place to write my ballads, if I wish. I'll not moon about for the lack.~
@1065349 = ~Well, it's like my Uncle Spanky used to say... there's just no point in wetting your pants and screaming if you suddenly find yourself on another plane. Especially if you're dead. What kind of a start to the afterlife would that be? Better to just look like you know what you're doing and impress the hell out of everyone. Of course, Uncle Spanky didn't often follow his own advice. He was once laughed off of Mount Celestial by a pair of mischievous planetars, I hear. (Bastards!)~
@1065395 = ~You talk like I had a choice. The fool was too far gone.~
@1065579 = ~Fine. I will accept your mission and find a way to destroy the "invincible" Yaga-Shura.~
@1065580 = ~I'll kill Yaga-Shura. But once the deed is done I better get something in return!~
@1065594 = ~Saradush Under Siege

With Gromnir dead, Melissan feels there is but one hope to save Saradush:  slay Yaga-Shura, fire giant leader of the army besieging the city. Melissan believes the death of their leader will demoralize the army, and they will give up their attempts to breach the defenses of Saradush. I can use my pocket plane special ability to get out of the city.~
@1065769 = ~Defeating Yaga-Shura

Melissan has warned me that the fire giant Bhaalspawn is immune to all weapons and magic.  Unless I can find some way to overcome his resistances any attempt to destroy him is doomed to failure.

Perhaps the secret to defeating him can be found in a swamp deep within the Forest of Mir, where Yaga-Shura was raised.  It is also possible that a cult of fire giants in the Marching Mountains knows a way to nullify Yaga-Shura's power.~
@1065868 = ~The curse of my Bhaal-tainted blood.  Whenever I was afraid, I would suddenly be teleported to a completely new part of the world. Most disruptive, especially while I was being hunted.~
@1065879 = ~By other Bhaalspawn, of course. Yaga-Shura, for one. Others. Whenever I tried to build a life, the hunters would show up and poof - I'd jump. Or teleport, if you rather. It's not a very comfortable thing to live with.~
@1065934 = ~Why do you think, fool? I am Yaga-Shura's unwilling concubine. Now release me at once!~
@1065947 = ~Wait! Wait. I have information. Release me and I will tell you what I know about the master of this place - the fire giant Yaga-Shura.~
@1065952 = ~No! NOOOO!! (sob!)  No, please... make it stop, <CHARNAME>, make it STOP!!~ [AERI2545]
@1065961 = ~Ah... free at last. I suppose I am in your debt. Well, I will be beholden to no <MANWOMAN>. Though it galls me, I will tell you what I know of Yaga-Shura.~
@1065964 = ~Khalid? No... this cannot be...~ [JAHE2526]
@1065966 = ~Tell me what you know about Yaga-Shura.~
@1065968 = ~Do you know how Yaga-Shura's invincibility can be overcome?~
@1065971 = ~I should cut your tongue out for your impertinence... but since I have no weapon, and since you did save my life...~
@1065972 = ~My name is Ehlastra, a warrior from the Northern lands. I had heard legends of Yaga-Shura, a Child of Bhaal born unto a giantess. I came to this place to see if the legends were true.~
@1065976 = ~So you came to kill Yaga-Shura?~
@1065979 = ~You simple fool! I came here to join Yaga-Shura, to offer my sword to his service, to follow the mighty giant as his army laid waste to the Southlands!~
@1065984 = ~I wanted to become part of his unstoppable war machine, to revel in the slaughter, to have my blade drip with the blood of all those Yaga-Shura crushed beneath his mighty boot!~
@1065988 = ~The fire giants in this Temple are short-sighted fools.  They recognized my warrior skills, but saw me only as a potential mate for Yaga-Shura, a chance for him to further spread Bhaal's seed.~
@1065989 = ~But now they are dead, and I yet survive. My only regret is that I could not kill Yaga-Shura's followers with my own hands. I have nothing more to say on this matter.~
@1065992 = ~I have heard the legends - Yaga-Shura cannot be defeated, he is immune to all weapons and magic, he is invincible. Perhaps this is true.~
@1066008 = ~Moira! Dearest sister, you... how can this be?!~ [ANOM2547]
@1066010 = ~It was Saerk who had you killed, dear sister, but I... I could not take vengeance! I could not...~ [ANOM2548]
@1066011 = ~Robbers ended your life, my sister, but I could not... I could not take vengeance upon them!~ [ANOM2549]
@1066015 = ~I... didn't mean to fail you! Please... please, Moira, I loved you! You... you didn't want to leave Father!~ [ANOM2551]
@1066017 = ~No! No, no! I... I never... by Helm, no! <CHARNAME>, I beg you! Make this stop!~ [ANOM2552]
@1066040 = ~Yaga-Shura is not so stupid as to share his secrets with me. But I have been here many months, and I have overheard bits and pieces of many conversations.~
@1066041 = ~I have heard mention of a name from Yaga-Shura's past:  Nyalee, an old crone who lives in the marshes of the Mir Forests. She may know Yaga-Shura's secrets.~
@1066042 = ~And I also know Yaga-Shura is obsessed with a golden chest he keeps hidden beneath his bed. Unfortunately, this is the full extent of what I have been able to learn in my captivity.~
@1066123 = ~Oh! 'Tis Nyalee's heart, it is! The spawn-child has found Nyalee's poor heart! And, yes... this be the boy's heart, as well. Gives Nyalee her heart and she will extinguish the boy's, she will, oh yes!~
@1066151 = ~Many of the words on these scattered pages have faded over the centuries.

..power of my electrical enchantments... our caged pet...the form of a green slime giant is vulnerable to lightning...

Only the final entry has survived in its entirety:

I finally have a plan to be rid of that sorry, slime-loving excuse for a mage.  If I turn my fan to its highest setting while the south-west door to his noxious laboratory is open the poison mist will be blown clear, making his noxious pets vulnerable!

I must remember to use my lightning on that ooze puddle, unless I want thousands of those things crawling around the dungeon.

Soon I will put my plan into action, and be rid of his caustic presence forever!~
@1066153 = ~The ink of this diary has run, oozing across the pages and smearing many of the words:

...forces we do not comprehend ... concentrate on my own research...    acid and poison are potent against its air incarnation...

The final words of the last page are the most legible:

...devised a way to be rid of the cold-hearted monster.  If I set the air mage's fan on high and open all the doors between the fan room, my own lab and the ice wizard's frigid chamber, the drafts will blow my toxic vapors down the hall towards the frost wizard's minions.  Once touched by the poison gas they will become tainted and vulnerable.  That snowblind fool won't know what hit him!

I can then close the doors or turn the fan back to the low setting, and the gas will drift back into my noxious lab to preserve my own precious pets.~
@1066154 = ~Protected by a thin layer of magical ice, this note is remarkably well preserved:

The others refuse to recognize my contribution to this project!  When the Demon assumes the shape of a winged, red-bodied beast it becomes vulnerable to my powerful winter magics, yet my "companions" insist their own enchantments surpass my own.

The flame mage, with his "invincible" servant, is the worst, of course.  But I have discovered the secret to destroying his precious giant!  

The fire elementals are the key - dispatch them and the giant becomes vulnerable!  I will lure each of the four elementals into my ice lab, and destroy them in my frozen realm.  This will trap their spirits in the ice crystals, and keep them from being reborn in the lava pit from which they are continually spawned!~
@1066163 = ~This device has been specially designed for lighting slow-burning torches.  It could come in useful if you ever need to light the torches set into the walls of the dungeon.~

@1068140 = ~Yes...so Rashemen is very far away. But what sort of place is it? Did you like it?~
@1068145 = ~Yes, Dynaheir was a good Rashemeni witch. But I am not so certain that the witches have need of their own hamsters. Dynaheir never approved of Boo... she used to glare at Boo so it frightened him sometimes.~
@1068163 = ~Sir Keldorn, as an initiate of the Order, I heard many a story of your prowess and courage. At one point, Sir Cassius made reference to your heroism on the Giant's Plain. He stopped abruptly and, with a dark look, would say no more. What happened there?~ [ANOM2517]
@1068164 = ~Aerie!  Boo has been mulling over a question for you.  Never have I seen a hamster concentrate so!  He has been so very quiet I thought perhaps I rolled over on him last night, which caused me great concern.~ [MINS2506]
@1068171 = ~Well... a Rashemeni witch accompanies a ranger on his dajemma and teaches him the lore of herbs, among other things. Well... Minsc and Boo have discovered a need of some of this lore, maybe.~
@1068184 = ~My stories aren't pointless! Now where was I? Oh, that's right. Gabber. His tongue was nothing but a long, skinny piece of flesh by the time the disease was done with it. But Gabber was determined to learn to talk. He did tongue exercises and tongue stretches everyday, and his tongue kept getting longer and more nimble the more he worked with it. They say he was able to pick locks with his unusual appendage, though I never had the privilege of witnessing that feat myself. By the time he was a young man he could flick that thing out a full two feet in front of his face and make the tip twirl like a Calim veil dancer.~

@1068298 = ~That is cruel of you, Anomen.  If I return to Faenya-Dail one day, it will be because I am ready to... not because someone felt it necessary to bully me into it.~

@1068402 = ~It appears your destiny may be far greater than perhaps even you at first suspected.  Great power awaits you, and I cannot help but remember that you carry the blood of Bhaal within your veins.~
@1068403 = ~I think my own place here is a part of destiny, as well.  I do not mean that in a presumptive way... I mean only that perhaps by fighting at your side I can have a small effect on our future.~

@1068477 = ~You look a little down, Edwin. You're not upset, are you?~ [IMOE2505]
@1068479 = ~You've become less blustery, I think. Maybe... maybe you're mad everyone else is finding destinies and prophecies and generally surpassing you in every way?~
@1068481 = ~I mean, even me, little frail Imoen is a big scary Child of Bhaal now! That's got to be frustrating.~
@1068507 = ~Oh yes, she was a fine-looking woman... to Kimble's eyes, at least.  She cast a spell on him far stronger than any sorcerer ever could.  But she wouldn't have anything to do with my cousin - she had dwarven princes and clan lords after her calloused hand, and she couldn't be bothered with a dirt poor turnip-farming gnome.  But Kimble's heart wouldn't be denied... he left his own family to follow this bewitching creature back to her clan home.~
@1068508 = ~Ye're losin me, gnome... I don't want some weepy love story.  I want killin' and death!  Give me blood!~
@1068535 = ~I am a druid, yes... and of course I would be happy to answer any of your questions, although that mischievous look of yours tells me I am about to be made fun of.~ [CERN2509]
@1068559 = ~That's exactly the kind of thing Twin-Hammers would say.  He was a ruthless, savage, bloodthristy outlaw who would kill anyone or anything that got in his way.  He used to repeatedly terrorize a certain gnomish village he frequently wandered through in his never-ending quest for profit and bloodshed.~
@1068565 = ~Ah. I have given that considerable thought, actually.~

@1068623 = ~I understand your sympathy for the townsfolk, my dove, and I love you for it all the more. But 'tis nothing to shy one's gaze from. Entropy is a good thing... the forces we are witnessing are completely enthralling...~
@1068629 = ~My assistance was not required in this case, but in essence you are correct. All things are torn down to create the new. 'Tis a cycle that we are part of and must accept.~
@1068649 = ~Ahh, Imoen, my wildflower. Have I ever told you that you've a most natural grace and innocent beauty about you? 'Tis something any man would find most charming.~ [HAER2505]
@1068651 = ~'Twas not meant as such. I've no intention of offending you.~
@1068653 = ~'Tis only that I see you in an unguarded moment, at times... and I see the ache in your heart reflected in your eyes. It saddens this sparrow to know there is no-one to hold you close, Imoen.~
@1068658 = ~Yes, I know. 'Tis an art form that has served this sparrow well, at times.~
@1068662 = ~Oh! Well, no... uh... I just thought...~ [IMOE2519]
@1068722 = ~I just be tryin' to come to a reckoning about yer nature, ye walkin' ghost.~ [KORG2516]
@1068727 = ~Ye're handy enough during a fight, but when I kill something I want to know it's gonna stay dead.  That's where I be havin' a problem with you.~
@1068730 = ~Aye, that be true enough, I guess.  Yer strange return to the land o' the livin' matters not.  As long as ye be willing to throw yer blade into the mix, ye're not hurting our group none.~
@1068731 = ~Hmph.  Imoen, ye're an o'er-lame excuse fer a member o' this party and I be tired of exertin' meself to protect ye!  Next time I let ye perish, screaming like a ninny as ye does!~ [KORG2505]
@1068735 = ~An outrage!  Ye're a canker on me backside and the world would be best rid of ye!  Loathsome mongrel she-dog!!~

@1068749 = ~That'd be a neat trick, bringing change to all of Amn. Wouldn't those Roenalls still be a thorn for you, though? And what about the Cowled Wizards?~
@1068750 = ~I'm an archmage, Imoen... just like you. The Roenalls won't stop me from doing what I know is right. And I could always join the Cowled Wizards... how many of them are as powerful as I?~
@1068755 = ~Even after my resurrection, violent rage pollutes my tainted blood. As <CHARNAME> can surely attest, it is a constant struggle to keep our bloodlust in check.~

@1068784 = ~Aye, ye're never in the mood for nothin' but weepy sentimentality!  Stop playin' adventurer and go back to yer cage in the circus!  At least if people pay a copper or two to see yer gangly, misshapen form ye might be worth somethin'!~
@1068786 = ~Ye're nothin' but a scrawny, whiny, stump-backed, miscastin' mage wanna-be!~
@1068787 = ~I'm sick of your insults, you bastard! You're worth less than the feces of an unwashed kobold! You're stupid, bigoted, mean, small-minded and small-membered! Now leave me alone or I'll cast a spell of withering on that pathetic excuse for a manhood you're always scratching at between your legs!~
@1068794 = ~Forgive this sparrow's curiosity, my fierce hound, but my eyes are drawn of their own accord.  You have walked where every mortal must eventually go, though precious few return as you have.~ [HAER2514]
@1068851 = ~No... uh... no offense intended, lassie.  Ye are indeed a fine-lookin' woman, and mighty powerful, too.  A true catch, if I say so myself.~
@1068886 = ~No doubt.  I've been saving some rather excruciating torture techniques for the occasion.~
@1068917 = ~(giggle!)  You're incorrigible, Jan.~
@1068952 = ~You have a venomous spider on your neck.  A lovely creature, known to cause an agonizing, blood-curdling death within moments of injecting its nerve poison.~
@1068955 = ~You know, this reminds me of the time Uncle Scratchy laid me flat with the handle of a horseman's flail.  'Look behind you!', he says.  'Why?  What's behind me?', I say.  'A Tiberian Dung Beetle!', he cries, looking frantic.  So of course I scream in terror and look behind me... and lost a bag of the most scrumptious turnips ever to come out of Scornubel.  Ma Jansen was furious and the lump was more painful than six weeks with the Calimshite Itch.~
@1068984 = ~Spit your bile in my direction if you must, but consider that it was your own machinations which caused your first death.  Fail to learn from that and you will die again with as little meaning.~

@1069039 = ~They are, they are.  Heroic, even.  But it strikes me sometimes that you are... overcompensating, a little?  That you are a little embarrassed, even... to be a halfling.~

@1069239 = ~Then you are of no further interest to me, rivvil... though I suspect your dreams will be filled with dark imaginings of the hedonistic pleasures you have denied yourself. But even your dreams will be but a pale shadow of my true decadence.~
@1069340 = ~I'm frightened of what's to come, <CHARNAME>. So much has changed so fast. I love you, but what if... what if I suddenly lose you? What if some irresistible force tears us apart? That's why I wanted to wait. Until things were more... stable.~
@1069362 = ~I offered my services to you because I knew you would require my aid and my knowledge, and because I knew yours would be the path of power.  But I also cannot foresee you allowing me my freedom.~
@1069453 = ~Ah, my love.  I always find your innocence so appealing.~
@1069518 = ~Go. Do what you must. I... I love you. (Jaheira kisses you, and then turns away, resigned to the decision she feels you have already made.)~
@1069544 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>.  We Avariel have a sixth sense about these types of things.  There is no mistake... I'm pregnant with your child, my love.~

@1069667 = ~Will you truly hear? You are so unsure of the future, of your feelings, even with my reassurances.~
@1069725 = ~I don't know. Much good could be done for the grand scheme of things. Little things work themselves out.~
@1069751 = ~Well, maybe it's time to start if this is going to work out between us.~
@1069791 = ~I have been thinking about us, my mrann d'ssinss.  Perhaps thinking too much.  Dwelling on such things leads only to head-aches and confusion, don't you agree?~ [VICO2504]
@1069866 = ~Mmmm, yes, you have always shown enthusiasm for this part of our relationship.  Let's see if you can translate that into a level of exertion that will please me, my mrann d'ssinss...~
@1069952 = ~Think of it, <CHARNAME>... a whole town of rivvin destroyed simply to get to you! Ha ha ha! If anything spoke of your destiny as a being to be feared, this is it!~
@1069993 = ~Perhaps this is not the best place for this discussion, my lady... but I must ask.  Does it not seem an injustice that even as you vanquish your enemies others instantly spring up to take their place?  Have you no regrets about what has become of your life?~ [ANOM2502]
@1070070 = ~Promise me that, my mrann d'ssinss.  I would rather remember you strong than know that you had given up the promise of true power for some distracting affection.~
@1070109 = ~It will take more than comforting words to dispel these demons from my past, <CHARNAME>!~
@1070133 = ~Good.  Then I have only one thing I wish to say to you, my mrann d'ssinss.~
@1070138 = ~But... in case something unforeseen does occur... let me hold you for one moment, <CHARNAME>.  Let us kiss as if for the last time, so that I may remember this even if nothing else...~

@1070165 = ~I... I am not asking you to make a decision, <CHARNAME>.  I pray you never have to choose.  But I want you to be ready should that decision ever come.  I... I should speak no more of this.  You alone can decide the path of your future, when the time comes.~
@1070166 = ~It is... something I have never said to you, before, because I was unsure if I truly felt that way.  I have called you mrann d'ssinss... lover... of my ssinssrigg... my love... but these are drow words.~
@1070254 = ~My love, may I speak to you?  In private.  It is a matter of... of greatest importance.~ [ANOM2508]
@1070290 = ~ I... I want you to know that I will not stand in the way of your destiny, my love.  Our love is the most important thing in my world - more important than my family, my honor.  Even my childhood dreams to join the Order seem insignificant beside my feelings for you.~
@1070390 = ~Recognized by strangers in the street - the ravens must already sing poems of your exploits, my friend.  Soon you will be the most famous <PRO_RACE> in the Realms... if you survive, of course.~

@1070543 = ~I wouldn't know about 'wondrous', but 'tis fair enough... for what little I have seen. Hmm... a tiefling, is it? You remind me of an actor I once saw, in a play, in a dream.~
@1070549 = ~Ah, yes. Aesgareth is well-known amongst certain circles as being most fascinated in his gambling pursuits. Above even interest in his own health, my raven...'tis a most unhealthy thing.~
@1070688 = ~Cloak of Mirroring

I've been sent to fetch and retrieve a gauth beholder's eyestalk for the mad wizard, Iycanth. Apparently, the gauth has disappeared into one of the pools to the east of Iycanth's lab.

The job seems beneath me, though Iycanth suggested subcontracting to a small group of adventurers. They have, however, been turned to stone. If I want to give them the 'Quest', I'll have to turn them back. Regardless, when I have the eyestalk, I am to find my way to the wizard's lab and exchange it for the Scroll of Reversal.~

@1073256 = ~Chapter 8

It has begun.

Even before I left Suldanessellar, the news had already begun pouring in from everywhere...tales of armies on the move, whole towns being destroyed to get at some lone wizard, massive carnage and destruction along the entire Sword Coast.  It all links to the Bhaalspawn.  They are being hunted, or hunting each other...whatever the case, wherever a Child of Bhaal is, violence soon follows.  And so the fear and panic have spread, with any innocent even suspected of having the taint being driven from their homes or killed outright.

Even the elven lands are not immune, and I sensed considerable relief upon my departure from the very city that I helped save.  Ellesime, at least, offered me some advice...there is a part of the old elven woods that house old ancestor spirits of the elves, spirits locked within giant carved faces made so long ago not even the elves remember when they were created.  It is a sacred place reserved only for royalty, but Ellesime is allowing me to enter the dale and glean what wisdom I can.

I have gone alone...none of the elven forest folk want to be near me.  And while no others are supposed to be here, I am sure that danger stalks me, yet.  I should prepare my weapons and equipment and be ready for anything...~
@1073292 = ~Yaga-Shura's army pours towards you, led by the giant Bhaalspawn himself, and you realize that you shall have to kill Yaga-Shura if you wish to break their ranks. If you fail to kill him soon, you may be overrun.~

Yet another interaction with the Solar...this time concerning my own place in Alaundo's prophecy.  Supposedly, I am the one Alaundo spoke of, but in the way that I am supposed to stop the rest of the Bhaalspawn from wrecking destruction and chaos upon the Sword Coast...rather than being solely responsible for it, myself.  I am unsure how to take this news, as it seems my place in the scheme of this is predestined.  I could be the most savage beast in the Realms, and yet the other Bhaalspawn would still see me as a threat to them?

It seems that this is so.  Whether I like it or not, I have been placed on a path to collide with the destinies of the remaining children of Bhaal.  And it seems my victory would be far preferable to theirs...at least as far as the prophecy is concerned.

Once again, the Solar has opened another of the portals to a challenge in the pocket plane.  There is more for me to learn about myself, yet, it appears.~

She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, becoming a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earning a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself.

One of her followers betrayed her, however, prompting the slaughter of the whole tainted lot. Shar admonished Viconia strongly for this, but she was unrepentant and again wandered the Realms. Viconia was still formidable, and went on to prevent an attempt by the Knights of the Shield to take over Calimport, and even worked with Drizzt Do'Urden to save the elven city of Suldanessellar from a Zhentarim plot. For this last act, the elves accepted her, and Queen Ellesime bestowed the highest honors of the Seldarine, an accolade never before given to one of her dark kind. Viconia reportedly bowed once without emotion, and then left. Her fate remains unknown.~

Viconia was poisoned by a servant of Lolth, her last words whispered to her loving mate in private. <CHARNAME> raised his son in secret, and tales vary on the result. Some say they waged a crusade against the drow, but all agree that the former child of Bhaal never forgot the love of his dark maiden.~ []
@1073946 = ~Elminster's Ecologies: Appendix IIIa

This time-worn tome is written by the sage Elminster, and apparently part of a much larger body of work containing detailed studies of most of the strange creatures from around Faerun.

The appendix seems to refer to newly-discovered variations on normal breeds of creatures.  Of particular interest:

"Dense Puddings - a relative of the slimes and molds, this pudding is relatively normal...except when exposed to electricity or fire.  When this occurs, it splits into new puddings and can therefore be very dangerous."

"Fire Trolls - a new form of troll thought to have been created by sorcerous Fire Giants for use as servants and guards.  They are similar to regular trolls in most respects except for their lava-temperature skin and burning touch.  Once they are defeated, they can only be permanently killed by cold or acid."

"Fission Slime - an off-shoot of the slimes and molds, this particular slime will split into new and independent creatures when hit.  It is vulnerable to fire, which will kill it permanently."

"Magic Golems - this rare type of golem is formed from pure magical energy and is completely immune to spellcraft as well as enchanted weapons.  To my knowledge, only weapons without enchantments have any effects on this creature."

"Mariliths - while this is apparently a legitimate form of demon, it is one that only an exceptional few have encountered and survived.  The Marilith is a six-armed demon with a human female front half and the back half of a snake.  She is incredibly quick and deadly, and on top of her martial prowess with six swords, she casts spells as well.  Fighters should beware: in addition to being immune to normal weapons and minor enchantments, this demon also likes to cast Immunity to Magic Weapons...which must be dispelled if a fighter is to have any chance with his armaments."~
@1073961 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

A man by the name of Peltje was babbling about a group of vampires in the city masquerading as prostitutes.  They base in the sewers, apparently, and might serve as a way to get inside the sewers...if a dangerous one.  Then again, this Peltje could be as insane as he claims he isn't.~

@2529214 = ~Summon Nishruu (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting the summon nishruu spell the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the Nishruu.  At first glance this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination this boiling, churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own.  Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the nishruu feed on the energies surrounding and used by wizards.  Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.  The nishruu have no physical attacks at all.  However, they can be hurt by physical attacks.  Each time a nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around him the wizard loses one memorized spell.  This is chosen at random. However, it will consume the highest level possible.  The nishruu is completely immune to magic (except for death spell), and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature.  The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, or the spell duration expires.~
@2529220 = ~Summon Hakeashar (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 8 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is similar to the 6th level wizard spell, Summon Nishruu.  The Hakeashar is a more powerful version of the Nishruu, having more hit points, better attacks, and immunity to normal weapons.
By casting the summon hakeashar spell the wizard calls into being a magical being of considerable power: the Hakeashar.  At first glance this appears to be some sort of mist but upon closer examination this boiling, churning grey mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own.  Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, this creature feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards (and other spellcasters).  Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.  The hakeashar has no physical attacks at all.  However, it can be hurt by physical attacks.  Each time the creature touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around him the wizard loses one memorized spell.  This is chosen at random.

The creature will remain under the wizards control until reduced to 0 hit points, or the spell duration expires.~
@2545867 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

Monks must be of Lawful alignments.

Advantages:
-  The monk can make 1 unarmed attack per round, and gains 1/2 an additional attack every 3 levels to a maximum of 4 attacks per round at level 18.
-  The damage inflicted by the monk's fists goes up as as the monk increases in levels:
Level 1-2:  1-6
Level 3-5:  1-8
Level 6-8:  1-10
Level 9-14:  1-12
Level 15+: 1-20
-  A monk's natural armor class gets better as the monk goes up in levels. Armor class starts off at 9, and then decreases by 1 for every 2 levels until level 21, then every 3 levels until 30, then every 5 levels until 40.
-  Stunning blow, once per day for every 4 levels. All attacks in the next 6 seconds force the victim to save or be stunned. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  Monks have the Deflect Missiles ability. This gives them a -1 to their AC vs missiles for every 3 levels.
-  The monk gains a +2 to save vs spells
-  A monk starts off moving at +2 move, then +1 move every 5 levels.
-  5th level:  Immunity to all diseases, and cannot be Slowed or Hasted.
-  7th level:  Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level
-  8th level:  -1 to speed factor
-  9th level:  +1 to all saves. Immune to charm. The monk's fist is considered a +1 weapon (+2 at 12th, +3 at 15th, +4 at 25th)
-  11th level:  Immune to poison
-  12th level:  Another -1 to speed factor.  Fists are considered +2 weapons. 
-  13th level:  Quivering palm spell once per day. This spell gives one hand attack. If an opponent is struck, the opponent must Save Vs. Death or die. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  14th level:  The monk gains 3% innate magic resistance per level (starting a 42% at 14th level, and reaching a maximum of 78%)
-  15th level:  Fists are considered +3 weapons
-  20th level:  Immune to non-magical weapons
-  25th level:  Fists are considered +4 weapons

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear any armor
-  May not use the off-hand in combat, so may only use one-handed weapons available to the thief class, may not carry a shield, and may not dual-wield (use a second melee weapon.)~ []
