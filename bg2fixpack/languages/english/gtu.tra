@1000856 = ~The journal lists a number of experiments, apparently conducted by a mage known as Lium the Lucky. The section dealing with the machine in front of you draws your eye:

"What a wondrous contraption! It creates, enchants, and dispenses magical equipment of no small power by pulling these six levers in the correct order. The ranking of the levers seems to change daily and pulling them in the incorrect order results in painful and instant death, as I've deduced from the bloodstains on the floor. I've gotten the order correct for the last few days and sent the items home with Pooky. It is well that I found the machine when I did for it hasn't much life left. Each item it creates damages the inner workings further and soon I fear it shall fall apart. The previous order was:
1) Ruby
2) Jade
3) Mithril
4) Onyx
5) Emerald
6) Sandalwood. 

I've taken apart what pieces of the machine I could, and found the device that sets the ranking of the levers. With it, as stated, the order for the past several days was clear. Now the cursed thing has broken and I've garnered hardly any information from it at all. This is what I *have* discovered:
A) The Jade Lever's change in ranking was the greatest of the six levers.
B) The product of the Onyx Lever's rankings for the two days (when multiplied) is same as the product of the Sandalwood Lever's last two rankings when multiplied.
C) None of the levers are ever in the exact same place in line as they were yesterday.
D) Obviously, due to the change in the Jade Lever's order, there are only two possibilities regarding the change in the orders of the Onyx and Sandalwood Levers, one of which contradicts another clue.
E) It is likely that the Mithril lever moved the same number of rankings as the Sandalwood Lever.

Quite the dilemma and the guesswork is risky. However, the items I've obtained are worth the risk and, with logic, I'm sure that I'll discover the correct order for today."

@1001763 = ~As you leave Suldanessellar, you are nearly overwhelmed by the cheering of the assembled crowds. There is open gratitude on the faces of the elves, and many times you are encouraged to stop and receive gifts or shake hands. There is an obvious lament at your departure, as well as an expectation of your return. They consider you a hero and, for once, you really feel the part.

You pass into the Forest of Tethyr, wondering if there could have been a future for you in the city that you have left behind. You examine the amulet around your neck, studying the images of elven gods inlaid in the platinum, and you feel the warm tingle of the item's magic. This gift will remind you of how welcome a visitor you would be, but it also bears witness to the fact that you are without a true home, a place where you belong. You could return to Athkatla, you think, but deep inside you feel the taint that yet remains in your soul.

There can be no home for you yet, as hard as that is to admit, so you venture deeper into the forest, pondering the words of demons, and growing annoyed at how destiny holds its secrets from your view.~ [NARR04]

I have spoken to the avatar of a god that no longer has the faith of the guardians who live in this dungeon. He asked me to take the relic he has vowed to protect, and combine it with the half that the beholder has. I may use the completed item to destroy the beholder... on several conditions. One: it can only be used once. Two: that I tell his people I intend to complete the item so that it can be returned here and be destroyed fully. Three: I bring the completed rod back and instill even the briefest moment of faith in his people, so the avatar might have the power to destroy the rod and end the service the guardians have been bound to.~ []
@1002028 = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

Now that I have returned with half of the rod, Sassar has told me of how to steal the other half from the beholder. The beholder lives in a great pit in the cult's temple that cannot be entered directly. I am to find a friend of Sassar's who stands near the Pit of the Faithless and, through him, gain access to a secret entrance to the pit and a niche where the beholder keeps his treasures... including the other half of the rod.~ []

@1002057 = ~Help Korgan recover the Book of Kaza.

I have joined with Korgan Bloodaxe to gain the Book of Kaza for a collector by the name of Pimlico. It is apparently in a tomb beneath the Grave District. One of the crypts apparently leads to a lower, older section rumored to contain undead... but also the tome.~ []
@1002069 = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

Once the beholder is killed, I must return the rod to the avatar... he has warned me that it is cursed, and I would not want to know what would happen if I dared to use the rod a second time or try to spirit it away from this place. Once that is done, I must also return to the temple and report my success.~ []
@1002073 = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Guardian Telwyn of the temple of Helm asked me to commission the master sculptor Sir Sarles to make a piece of artistry while he is in Athkatla. I will need to procure illithium for the artist and convince him to lower his outlandish fee. The other temples in the city will also be vying for his favor. Sir Sarles is staying in the Jysstev estate in the southeast corner of the Government District.~ []
@1002076 = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Dawnbringer Sain has asked that I commission the master sculptor Sir Sarles to produce a work for the temple. I must procure illithium... a rare metal that he demands to work with... and also convince him to lower his outlandish fee. Other temples will be vying for his services as well. Sir Sarles can be found at the Jysstev Estate in the southeast portion of the Government District.~ []

Now that this business with the sculptor is completed, Dawnbringer Sain has asked that I return to speak with him as soon as I am able... to continue my service for the temple.~ []
@1002080 = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

I have met with the artist, Sir Sarles... but the only way he will perform the work is if I can procure 200 pounds of pure illithium. Sarles recommended I locate an ore merchant by the name of Jerlia, who has a stall in the second tier in the southwest portion of Waukeen's Promenade.~ []
@1002083 = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Jerlia has fashioned the illithium alloy for me... now all I need to do is give the metal to Sarles and hope that he does not distinguish between it and the real thing.~ []
@1002088 = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Unger Hilldark told me that his latest shipment of illithium was stolen by a gnome named Neb. Unger cannot get the illithium back himself because the word of a Duergar is not trusted in Amn. If I am to get real illithium, I will have to exact justice on this bandit myself. Unger tells me that Neb bought a house in the Bridge District, marked as 'derelict house' on the map. The name 'Neb' sounds oddly familiar.~

(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 4
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is similar to the second level wizard spell Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character's saving throws are made with a +4 bonus. Multiple castings of Improved Invisibility are not cumulative.

Note: after making an attack the mage is no longer completely invisible.  Opponents can target the mage.~

After leaving the government building, I ran into a representative of the group of magicians who cast the curse on Jaheira... a man by the name of Terrece. He offered me the opportunity to bribe his group so as they would not come to Ployer's aid against me... apparently, they have little love for the man. We could not come to a deal, however... and I am not even sure the man could be trusted, anyway. It might simply have been one of Ployer's tricks. Aside from all of this, I still need to locate Ployer, himself.~ []

Jaheira has returned to the group, and has told me that she has been summoned to the Harper compound in Athkatla... and that I am to go there, as well.

Jaheira has returned to the group, and has told me that she has been summoned to the Harper compound in Athkatla... and that I am to go there, as well. I am not to be told why, apparently... and Jaheira refused to tell me. She left, in fact, to go there immediately and warned me that it would be best if I went to the compound as quickly as possible, where she would wait.

This ring is relatively unadorned, but the vile magic within radiates intense evil. Indeed, its creator, Kangaxx, was no less evil himself, even before millennia of undeath honed his power. It is said that a cadre of Netheril mages fought and imprisoned the demilich once, but being unable to truly destroy him they became liches themselves to stand guard over his remains. The construction of the ring may have led to their enmity, as each of the gem's nine facets was supposedly empowered by sacrifice and death.

Isaea has returned and arrested Nalia through the abuse of his own power in the military. He claims that she is 'under bad influences' and not acting according to her station. Nalia protested, but he is the only one who can be complained to, apparently, so there seems to be no recourse. I am not even sure where she is being held.~ []

Samia, the relic hunter in Firkraag's dungeon, was not what she seemed. Her plan was to get a dupe to get the treasure within the tomb for her... and then kill whomever retrieved it with the help of her companions. Fortunately, she has paid for her arrogance.~ []
@1005822 = ~Lavok is dead, the sphere returned.

Lavok has returned the sphere to our home plane and is now dead. Before he died, however, he granted the sphere to me... perhaps because I am a magic-user myself, I do not know. He asked me to use the construct wisely... more wisely than himself... and then died. What secrets lay in the place and how it even operates, I am not sure... but it is a grander base than any other mage might have, that is certain.~ []
@1005823 = ~The prophecy of Sekolah

The High Priestess seemed to think that I was the one her prophecy spoken of, and that I will save this Sahuagin city. Another priestess disagreed, however, and the King decided that a trial by combat was needed to settle the issue. I refused to play their game and decided to fight my way through this place.~ []

After the disappearance of the two spirits, Amuana appeared and rewarded me with a wardstone that she claims will render whoever holds it and all with them invisible to the Shade Lord's guardian... which she says to be a Shadow Dragon. She warned me to be careful not to drop the stone or attack the dragon and I would be safe, then thanked me and disappeared.~ []

Through this spell, the caster imbues himself with the strength and skill of a fighter of the same level. The priest's strength is set to 18/00, even if it is normally higher, his THAC0 becomes that of a fighter of the same level, and he gains 1 temporary hit point for every level he has attained.

@1006210 = ~The... bracers. Oh you little fool. If you recall, I was not going to get ridof them... I was going to DISPOSE of them. There is a large difference, especially considering what they were.~ []
@1006211 = ~You put them on, didn't you. Of course you would, how could you know. Melicamp...

@1006220 = ~Why yes mercenary, they might be considered priceless to some. As pricless as any value you can place on suffering or pain. I may know a scholar or two that would give their mothers for them, but 'tis not enough. It could never be enough. It really doesn't matter at this point regardless, as the damage is done and they have most likely disappeared. They have teleported away in the past after use, and 'twas but sheer luck alone that returned them to me.~ []
@1006221 = ~They are a relic of my adventuring days, and a monument to the years I spent enslaved beneath... beneath where, I cannot say. 'Twas foolish to be anywhere near a Netheril ruin, but I was young and stupid once as well. I was entrapped... I will say no more about that. I escaped, and brought what I could. The bracers remain a mystery, and I have no idea their true function. In the past I have seen them wielded for horrific purpose, but any HUMAN that put them on was instantly killed as often as not.

@1006526 = ~Flame Tongue +4

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough -- it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself -- but whoever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging suspicion that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

@1007282 = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:  

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history. Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin. When Raurin fell in 2488DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia. Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged. Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy. All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity. Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life. Merchants were honored above all. In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants. During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the council of merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries. War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement. During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed. Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath. The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every ablebodied fighting man they sent. The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts. He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time. He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things. He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade. He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems. He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life. Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range. They roamed as far east as Kara Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa. At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zaakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.

@1007283 = ~History of Tethyr: 

For the past 1,500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power. When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne. As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne. Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so). 

The established recurring cycle was broken 10 years ago. The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr. King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr. Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well. Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies. Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury. These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change. 

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however; it takes treachery as well. In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and an impatient royal heir. Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army. While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile. By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help. 

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates. At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father. A fire set by the elite troops would destroy evidence of treachery; the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government. 

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point. Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire. At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid. 

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family. Once Castle Tethyr began to fall there was no holding back the mob. In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin. Everything of value - fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust. 

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos. In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword. This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding." 

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell. Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived. These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr. 

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted. "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society. The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~ []
@1007293 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule. 
~ []
@1007294 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Khelben Kills Jyordhan: 

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~ []
@1007296 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords: 

 During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Manes' Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonement by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures. 
~ []
@1007297 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale: 

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune(wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well. 

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there is little validity to the claim.

@1007304 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:  

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was of great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command or the sea.

The power of Norhkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races, however these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep - its slender, now-broken spires - can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~ []
@1007324 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:  

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked - Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day. 

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land - freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.

@1007335 = ~History of the Dead Three:  'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE' 

In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well. Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable. 

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals - Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul - who lusted after the power Jergal wielded. The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the Realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually the trio destroyed one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves. 

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes or noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest - the Bone Throne. 

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant. "I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. "And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer. 

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, "The Throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish - I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position."  Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued, "who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened. "after all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal. 

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed. Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest. 

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened. "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players. When Malar returned form chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die - even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him. 

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.

@1007343 = ~Axe +2 throwing: 'Rhyte's Last Arrow'
The tale of this weapon lost its significance in the sea of great stories that are told about the High forest, but some bards still sing the song of the skilled archer Adaniss Rhyte.
 
Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

The evil lord demand justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

'With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

Again called the forest with its precious game
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut
But first flew Adaniss' axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off 
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still
Never missing a kill
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

Suryris, a white minotaur who traveled the Orsraun mountains in Turmish, lived for nothing but the thrill of combat, and encouraged warriors to challenge him for his magical weapon: a powerful halberd. Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower. Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat. The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryis knew he likely would have been bested had it continued. He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.

Its namesake was the original owner of the weapon, and his tale, though mostly long forgotten, was wrought with treachery and deceit.

Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies. Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified, and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power. In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form. Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few who knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated, she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness, he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. There Galloma, a wizard living in the area, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends, and more: they were master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's apprenticeship could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced his weak body. This weapon has no speed factor.

Driven by years of rivalry, the Dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them. Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon. He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloating about his advantage. The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.

With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood. The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest. Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily . . . nay, VERY happily ever after!

The ring was removed (by a method known only to the wily jester) only once the stooge had promised no reprisals for the treatment he or she had received; even so, Gregoria frequently had to make a hasty retreat.

This ring and several of its type were originally crafted to protect the sons of King Castter De'wess, though who uttered the enchantment is unknown. History records that the rings remained within that family for at least 13 generations, though they were all apparently lost within the space of one. Enmity between the King and the family of the creator may be to blame.

The Guard was an immortal sentry assigned to protect a tomb that sheltered the body of a princess of the Akanal. As time passed, respect for the grave disappeared with the memory of the royal family, and adventurers began to try their luck with the Guard. It was inevitable that he would eventually be bested, and when he was, the ring he wore was one of many treasures taken from the tomb.

@1007367 = ~Ring of Energy: 'The Victor'
Crafted by Drow mages of the Underdark, this weapon was used in an arranged battle between two rival houses. Each combatant was allowed to use a single magic item to aid his efforts. This ring was the weapon used by the victor of the contest, though he never laid hands on it. It was worn by his sibling and fired from the crowd, striking his opponent squarely in the back. Everyone witnessing agreed it was a brilliant interpretation of the rules.

@1007370 = ~Ring of Folly: 'Discipliner'
Oft the bane of the careless mage, this ring was actually used to promote humility. Hergat Norin, a grand wizard of Narfell, would give the Discipliner to his most skilled, and most egotistical, students. Through their blind arrogance they would mistake the ring as a reward for their "obvious brilliance," and not the punishment of a disapproving teacher.

@1007371 = ~Necklace of Missiles: 'The One Gift Lost'

The naming of this necklace originates from its only owner, Ikaida Mourneve, who quested to regain his kidnapped daughter. Not many would help the determined father, but a kind and generous mage bestowed this item on him to aid his cause. Alas, the necklace was lost when Ikaida dropped it into the Immerflow River while fending off bandits upon a suspension bridge. Fortunately, it is rumored that the item was not needed to reunite the family once again.

The royal guard of King Pyronan, ruler of Impiltur, were given 'The Protector' as an honorary show of status. Unfortunately, members of the guard had trouble coming to a consensus amongst themselves regarding who should receive the amulet. After years of internal hostility, the item was lost and the guards were replaced by less greedy individuals.

This amulet was carried into dungeons deep within the Thunder Peaks nearly 600 years ago. Mistakenly overestimating the power of this item, the owner foolishly ventured too far, and met his end there. It remains a mytery how and by whom the amulet was removed from the dark caverns.

@1007374 = ~Amulet of Metaspell Influence: 'The Amplifier' 
Known for its ability to enhance spellcasting, the Amulet of Metaspell Influence is highly sought after by practitioners of magic. It was created by Elairdrin Mellwith who resided in the Star Mountains. His reasons for fabricating such an item stemmed from his womanizing habits, and to this end the Amplifier served his purpose well. It was later taken from him by a mage with a more destructive intent, but records detailing the change of hands vary widely.

In ages past, a king named Rhigaerd was renowned for the spies he kept. So skillful were they, that no nook or cranny escaped their eyes, and maps were held for entire castles and towns.

The archers, each equipped with an enchanted bow and bracers, hid within range of the gathering. As predicted, enemy troops attempted to seize the King, but none had anticipated the amazing accuracy and lethality of the hidden archers. The King was able to escape unharmed; in fact, none of the ambush members even lived to approach him.

There was no great crisis at hand, nor dangerous evil to be overthrown; just a wish for a friend to give a gift to another. It could just as easily have been a good book or a bottle of wine, but adventurers are eminently more practical in their gift giving. The helm has seen many great battles since its creation, but the simple virtue at its core is what has always been remembered.

Level: 8
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None

When using this spell, the wizard points at a target and utters the Power Word. Any creatures within a 10 foot radius of the target then become sightless for the duration of the spell. All of the effects of blindness apply to the victims, such as -4 penalties to THAC0 and armor class.~ []
@1007785 = ~I do not stoop to such tactics, even in the darkest of times. Such methods have no place here. Doubly so because I do not believe he is responsible.~ []
@1007788 = ~Phantom Blade (Evocation) 
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. This silent construct is blade-shaped. Its cutting edges inflict damage just as those of a real sword. The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with the weapon, at his or her normal THAC0. The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of hit and damage bonuses, and in determining the type of creatures it can hit. However, due to its ethereal nature, it causes an extra +10 damage to the undead. This sword can only be used by the caster, and remains in his or her hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~ []
@1007789 = ~One would think so, but he is not guilty, of this I am sure. I can tell these things. He says he has been sent to investigate the druids himself.~ []
@1007791 = ~Something like that, though it is more complicated. He is not guilty, of this I am sure. He says he has been sent to investigate his fellow druids.~ []
@1007796 = ~Very well, though if we are challenged by any townsfolk it will be their deaths.~ []
@1007797 = ~I will decide only when I have spoken with this man.~ []
@1007806 = ~Those that attack will have taken their lives into their own hands. Do what you must, but I will not tolerate the killing of innocents. Keep that in mind.~ []
@1007808 = ~Tenser's Transformation (Alteration) 
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. When the wizard casts the spell, he or she undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, turning him or her into a formidable fighting machine. The wizard's hit points double, with all damage sustained subtracting first from the magical points gained. The armor class of the wizard improves by 4, up to a maximum armor class of -10. All attacks are made as a fighter of the same level as the wizard (i.e., the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved for fighters). Furthermore, each attack is made with a +2 bonus to hit, and each successful hit inflicts an additional 2 points of damage.

NOTE: This spell does not give the caster any extra attacks, and all special abilities (both cast and innate) are unusable in the transformed state.~ []
@1007818 = ~Arla's Dragonbane +3~
@1007828 = ~We are in your debt for whatever you did. I thank you, and Trademeet thanks you. Not only have the attacks stopped but we have received reparations from the remaining druids.~ [CeLoga08]
@1007829 = ~Hail and hello! Excuse my jovial manner but we have been celebrating. Trademeet was under siege not long ago, and now the attacks have simply stopped.~ []
@1007837 = ~Perhaps he might. You shall have to ask him. I leave you to it. Other concerns of the town must still be dealt with.~ []
@1007838 = ~Then I shall free him. A pity you will not meet him; he's interesting, and keen on traveling. Farewell. Other concerns of the town must still be dealt with.~ []
@1007840 = ~I have no interest in him.~ []
@1007845 = ~Ahh, the blight shall pass and I will return to cultivate better relations when the time is right.~ []
@1007846 = ~Your father is correct... your sister's murder cannot go unpunished. Saerk is clearly evil, and is it not every knight's responsibility to destroy evil?~ []
@1007848 = ~The answer is obvious. Everything that is wrong with this situation is the product of this man Saerk's scheming... your father's poverty and sister's death both. Saerk's life shall surely be forefeit for that of your sister's, and his wealth will become your father's.~ []
@1007852 = ~Black Blade of Disaster (Evocation) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about three feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster's level of proficiency with this weapon is that of a grandmaster. The sword acts as a +6 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Also, upon each successful hit the victim must make a save vs. death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword will drain 4 levels from the target, and heal the wielder by 20 hit points.~ []
@1007856 = ~Coprith sent me, but I don't trust you. What exactly are you trying to do here?~ []
@1007857 = ~I am indifferent about you. Once you are out of town you are on your own.~ []
@1007865 = ~I am called <GABBER>. What have you to offer me in exchange for freedom?~ []
@1007868 = ~Perhaps it could, but would you be willing to let your sister's killer go free so that you can join the Order?~ []
@1007876 = ~You are honor-bound to the vows you made to the Order. The path you are considering is evil, Anomen... do not take it.~ []
@1007885 = ~Yes, I will help as best I can. Join with me and we shall do what must be done.~ []
@1007887 = ~I will help as best I can, but I do not wish any more traveling companions.~ []
@1007889 = ~This holds no interest for me and neither does your company. Go on your way.~ []
@1007895 = ~This holds no interest for me and neither does your company. Go on your way.~ []
@1007900 = ~Nor should I expect you to. Druids alone should handle these squabbles, but I am thankful for what help you can give. Come, the grove is on your map.~ []
@1007901 = ~I will help as best I can, but I do not wish any more traveling companions.~ []
@1007903 = ~I will mark its location for you on your map. Do hurry. What transpires there will regrettably affect others outside the order.~ []
@1007914 = ~This is a matter that is best handled by the local authorities.~ []
@1007915 = ~To be honest, I'm not sure that I trust your father's version of events. All that he speaks of seems to be colored by his hatred of Saerk.~ []
@1007920 = ~I'm sure that many of the Order have faced difficult choices and yet have chosen to keep their vows. Do not take a mission of revenge.~ []
@1007922 = ~I'm sure that many of the Order have faced difficult choices and yet have chosen to keep their vows. Do not take a mission of revenge.~ []
@1007925 = ~Yes, I would be glad to have you in my party and help as best I can.~ []
@1007931 = ~Protection From Magic Energy (Abjuration)
Level: 6
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

When Protection From Magic Energy is cast, it confers upon the target complete invulnerability to all magic damage, such as that from Magic Missile or Abi Dalzim's Horrid Wilting.~ []
@1007944 = ~There's a WHAT in their chicken?

I purchased a Beljuril gem from a farmer in Imnesvale who had hidden it from thieves inside one of his chickens. I paid the man a fair price, for which he was glad... apparently, his adventurer daughter had paid for the gem with her own life.~ []
@1007945 = ~Go and investigate the local druids. See how far their taint runs and then return to tell me.~ []
@1007964 = ~If that is your choice, so be it. I will remain here until I can accomplish this task on my own. Perhaps if you change your mind... well, we shall see.~ []
@1007967 = ~You return as the dusk, though I hope you choose not to bring darkness to this meeting. Have you decided to aid in the cleansing of this druid grove and end the suffering of Trademeet?~ [CERND63]
@1007972 = ~Your investigations have been fruitful? Let us examine them for possible solutions to this regrettable situation. Speak what you have learned of the local druids. How are they tainted?~ [CERND64]
@1007977 = ~Nay, father. It is time for this foolishness to end.~ [ANOMENB5]
@1007997 = ~You have the ranger Minsc in your group. Likely he will also understand the danger of balance being lost, even though I have heard he has lost his own.~ []
@1008003 = ~I have obeyed you all my life and received naught but bitterness in return. My friend and I shall take this matter to the magistrate, as the law requires.~ []
@1008007 = ~You have seen the lifeless ashes of your sister, Anomen. Let not this terrible act go unpunished! Gird thy heart with righteous anger and slay thy sister's murderer!~ []
@1008017 = ~Shut your mouth! If you leave now you are forever banished from this place. You will be cast from this family and become a nameless dog, not fit to cower at my feet!~ [COR08]
@1008021 = ~I spoke with Faldorn, a Shadow Druid. She awaits challenge from another druid.~ []
@1008028 = ~You have seen the grave of your sister, Anomen. Let this terrible act... not go unpunished! Gird thy heart with righteous anger and slay thy sister's murderer!~ [COR06]
@1008037 = ~My son! My son! You have grown strong in your absence. Perhaps this knighthood you seek is the true path, after all. I am proud. You have restored our honor and our fortune.~ [COR07]
@1008039 = ~I must get going, son. My old employees must be found and reinstated. I shall send for you when things have been set aright, Anomen. Goodbye, son.~ []
@1008040 = ~It... it is done, father. The murderer is dead and I pray that Moira's spirit rests easy because of it.~ []
@1008043 = ~Good bye, father.~ []
@1008047 = ~I am Sir Ryan Trawl, a Paladin of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. In Torm's name I greet thee.~ []
@1008048 = ~Indeed it has. In the name of the Prelate, the council requests your return to the High Hall.~ []
@1008054 = ~And also thee.~ []
@1008062 = ~Invisible Stalker
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the elemental plane of Air. This 8 hit dice monster obeys and serves the spellcaster, performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 9 hours or until it is killed, at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having had to serve a mortal.~ []
@1008068 = ~I refer to, of course, my possible acceptance into the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, as a knight. We must travel there soon, else I shall be judged unworthy by default.~ []
@1008087 = ~Excellent. We are all the stronger having joined. Let's go quickly, before she rallies any more wayward druids to her cause.~ []
@1008094 = ~Then we will go there presently and you may watch my victory or defeat. For all concerned, I hope I am the champion nature deserves.~ []
@1008099 = ~Excellent. Let us waste no more time with idle chatter.~ []
@1008100 = ~I need not put up with this nonsense. I shall set out on my own for the High Hall, since you seem intent on keeping me from my commitments! You have caused me to be late in arriving at my own Judgement.~ [ANOMENB3]
@1008105 = ~I thank you. Once this matter is resolved I will be more than happy to assist you in your endeavors.~ []
@1008106 = ~I feared Shadow Druids were to take this land and was sent from the north to investigate, but now I hear I am no longer needed?~ []
@1008107 = ~That is true. We saw the trouble brewing in this place and decided to take action.~ []
@1008113 = ~Staff of the Magi +5~
@1008121 = ~Staff of Power +2~
@1008127 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

It appears that Tolgerias, a Cowled Wizard, has taken my promise to perform an unnamed service for him seriously. He had asked me to track down a man by the name of Valygar Corthala and bring him back dead or alive. I refused... and may face retaliation from the Cowled Wizards as a result.~ []

@1008171 = ~You have slain a man in revenge. By killing Saerk you have committed an unforgivable sin. Consider yourself lucky to be able to leave with your life.~ []
@1008178 = ~Do as the Prelate suggests, Anomen. You have worn out your welcome and must no longer taint this place with your presence.~ []
@1008180 = ~As I said, you may leave now, Anomen.~ []
@1008200 = ~In short, I've bettered myself in every way so that I might someday be Judged worthy of knighthood.~ []
@1008208 = ~A knight, however, has something of the stature that a paladin enjoys.~ []

@1008217 = ~These pathetic skirmishes of ours aren't worth the time I spend cleaning my weapons after the battle. Ah... the Order's campaign against the Hillgnasher giants... now that brought the blood up.~ [ANOMEN64]

This is Anomen's family shield, given to him by his father.

Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection. This particular suit of armor provides an additional +1 bonus to the wearer's armor class, a +1 bonus to all saving throws, and confers upon the wearer a limited free action enchantment (the wearer is able to pass through webs and other such effects).

@1008492 = ~Hallowed Redeemer +2~
@1008493 = ~Hallowed Redeemer

Keldorn distinguished himself early in his career as a paladin, and received this blade as a boon from Torm.

@1008503 = ~Staff of the High Forest +2~
@1008504 = ~Staff of the High Forest +2~
@1008505 = ~Staff of the High Forest

This staff finds its origin within a cycle of seasons in which Cernd meditated on his role within nature. His perch for this personal journey was next to a sapling, a young oak that was of particular interest; it seemed odd, and yet somehow wonderfully ordered. At the coming of spring Cernd examined it one last time, and it came loose in his hands, a living staff, granted as a boon from nature herself. It has grown to fit his grip, and no other may wield it.

@1008508 = ~Cloak of the High Forest

In his younger years, Cernd spent a cycle of seasons meditating on his role within nature. He made no shelter for himself, wanting to be completely unencumbered by the trappings of civilization. Nature may have appreciated his intent, but She also knows that, for all their dedication, at times her children can be foolish. Cernd found this cloak before the cold season set in, seemingly woven from the very undergrowth to fit him perfectly. The message was clear: he can appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it. Only Cernd may use this cloak.

@1008715 = ~Attack Roll (Left) ~ []
@1008718 = ~I am sure it is not like that everywhere... and not with everybody. But you could certainly try harder, Viconia.~ []
@1008722 = ~(giggle!)  Uh... you should probably talk to Rumie, here. OK?~ []
@1008724 = ~I have acted... poorly towards you. I... I wish to apologize.~ [VICONI72]
@1008725 = ~The years have taken your memory, Igarol, though even the greatest crags are eroded by the rivers of time. It is Cernd, and once you called me neighbor.~ []
@1008726 = ~I have been watching you in combat, Korgan... you fight well for the unblessed. Perhaps the blood sacrifices that you make to your primitive gods work after all.~ [ANOMEN50]
@1008729 = ~Certainly, make fun if you wish, but you... did not deserve my insults. You are the only surfacer who has treated me fairly, and not demanded something in return.~ []
@1008730 = ~Chapter 3

Throughout my time in Athkatla and my adventures in and around the city, I have seen hints of some great struggle between the Shadow Thieves and some other source... a guild filled with vampires and perhaps even greater evils.

The enemies of the Shadow Thieves are now my enemy, of that I am sure. Gaelan has sent me with a key to meet the Shadowmaster of the Shadow Thieves, he who controls the entirety of this powerful organization: Aran Linvail. This is by far preferable to receiving 'help' from vampires... although I somehow doubt that the gold I gave Gaelan is the last of the final price I will have to pay for help from the Shadow Thieves.~ []
@1008739 = ~I... I don't know why you to say that, but I assure you it is I. Like the hare changes coats to suit the season, I am different but the same. You must see th...~ []
@1008740 = ~Yer idiocy is surpassed only by yer unskilled flounderin' on the field o' battle. Stupid boy! Yer vassal to a selfish god, given useless power in swap for your soul.~ [KORGAN45]
@1008743 = ~Still you do not see! I question not your service to the lands, but do not speak to me of duty when you are the one who abandoned his wife!~ []
@1008745 = ~You... you are not too bad to travel with. For a lowly male, that is.~ []
@1008749 = ~Understood what? No, Cernd, how could you ask her to understand something that you do not? Yes, nature called to you and you went, but no doubt you were afraid to stay.~ []
@1008784 = ~Wh... what?~ []
@1008785 = ~With child, Cernd, you left with your child on the way.~ []
@1008790 = ~She never... I never heard... When did she...?~ []
@1008793 = ~Within nine months of your leaving, I would imagine. Not quite as attuned with nature as you thought, eh? Or did you subconsciously know and left because of it?~ []
@1008799 = ~I thank you, Igarol, even though this news is most troubling. I must speak with Galia and tell her... tell her my thoughts.~ []
@1008803 = ~Why not? All that I am has been gained through my own strength. Ye've naught but that which is doled out to you by a frolicking godling.~ []
@1008808 = ~'Tis obvious, dwarf, that you speak out of jealousy. So, too, would I, in your position.~ []
@1008812 = ~So... what draws you to this part of Faerun? Amn? Athkatla? I seem to recall you mentioning something about a mission or some bother.~ [VICONI67]
@1008814 = ~I need to know who captured me, for what purpose and what they have in mind for Imoen.~ []
@1008817 = ~Well, she has been my closest friend since childhood and a loyal companion.~ []
@1008819 = ~Oh, how intriguing. If I didn't know better, it would seem that there is an unsavory attraction between you two.~ []
@1008822 = ~It is a path of conscience. Some druids choose a contemplative lifestyle, but I sought a more active role in the furthering of nature's cause. And you? Did you become a priest of Helm only for honor and glory?~ [JAHEIR62]
@1008828 = ~The game autosaves when you leave a party-required area. If you die, check your auto save.~ []
@1008835 = ~Do not patronize me, <CHARNAME>! I don't appreciate your brusque manner or where your eyes are grazing at the moment.~ []

@1008847 = ~You don't need to continue your story... I think I can see where this is heading. Come, let us go.~ []
@1008850 = ~I had grown weak in my trust. They chortled as I lost consciousness, saying how easy it had been and congratulating each other on a fine... a fine catch.~ []
@1008855 = ~I wish to... apologize... for attempting to unburden myself upon you before. I was foolish to be so weak in Beregost, and worse yet to speak to you about it.~ [VICONI69]
@1008870 = ~You would think me terrible enough, abbil, if you knew enough about me. I am drow... make no mistake about that.~ []
@1008879 = ~You are coy, yet you stare from the corner of your eyes. (chuckle)  You are a salivating dog... but I'll be sure to offer a pleasing view for you now and then, hmm?~ []
@1008882 = ~Well... what about me, for instance?~ []
@1008885 = ~Yes. Let us... continue on our way, then, <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1008889 = ~No... no, don't go, Viconia. I apologize... I wasn't thinking.~ []
@1008890 = ~As... as you wish. You do not need to apologize, however... I have treated you poorly... for no good reason. Let us continue on, then, with a new slate.~ []
@1008898 = ~True enough, but I think I was speaking of emotional markings.~ []
@1008902 = ~I must take this path. I did care for Galia, but it was not to be. I thought I had laid these things to rest, but it appears I didn't do a very good job.~ []
@1008904 = ~This is a vicious weapon used by Neb. It is covered with old blood, and coated in a poison that is both quick-acting and extremely deadly. Only the truly evil would stoop to using such an item. Once the poison is used up, however, Neb's Cutter will act as a normal enchanted dagger.

@1008948 = ~Dead? But... Igarol... Fennecia, what happened. Tell me.~ []
@1008952 = ~Try to be a bit more forgiving. He only wants to know what has happened.~ []
@1008954 = ~Yes, well he would, wouldn't he? It doesn't matter, really. What's done is done and there's not a damn thing he can do to make it better.~ []
@1008955 = ~The easy way to learn what happened would have been to have not run off. I guess he didn't consider that method though.~ []
@1008958 = ~Galia... died a few months ago. I ain't saying nothing, but it didn't seem natural. No fuss made... Deril's got a wallet for the guard, if you get my drift?~ []
@1008959 = ~Galia's son... Cernd's son... is with Deril now. No doubt the boy will be an unthinking lout... if not from the family line then from example.~ []
@1008964 = ~The guard will do what to who? The child is an orphan of a woman whose husband ran off. They are less than garbage in this town.~ []
@1008970 = ~Well, you sure sound like his other guests. He doesn't like to be disturbed, but I will tell him you are here. Maybe you are just late for the party, or whatever.~ []
@1008974 = ~Odd time to develop a spine, Cernd. I was expecting him to attack right there.~ []
@1008982 = ~Well, it is here... er... I am here and we have matters that we must discuss!~ []
@1008986 = ~I... I...~ []

@1009017 = ~There... there is no delay, Lagole. I was just dispatching some... some servants. You! Take this brat and get out of my sight! I have no time for this now!~ []
@1009024 = ~I suppose... You don't move though. Lot's of guests come today, so maybe you are guests too. First ones to use the door though.~ []
@1009025 = ~You don't know him none. Deril is one big... er... he don't enjoy no one's company. You get lost.~ []

@1009027 = ~You're a man who looks like they could use a few extra coins. How about I pay you to let me in and you go get Deril? Good idea? Let's say, oh, 1,000 gold?~ []
@1009029 = ~A thou... You betcha! I goes and gets him! Just you waits!~ []
@1009030 = ~Well, how about 1,000 gold then? Will that work?~ []
@1009032 = ~Well, how about 1,000 gold then? Will that work?~ []
@1009040 = ~Oh, stow it! I have come for Cernd's child and you will hand it over!~ []
@1009050 = ~Weep not for the servant. I will rebuild him at my leisure. You, however, I shall leave in pieces. Who are you and what do you wish here?~ []
@1009065 = ~Perhaps it grew tiresome, just as your company has, and whispering 'Cernd' she sipped hemlock-laced wine... or perhaps I pushed her down the stairs. Take your pick.~ []
@1009073 = ~My conscience can allow me to be idle no longer. In the name of all that is good, I accuse you of willfully committing acts of evil.~ [MAZZY69]

@1009085 = ~ Oooh... we have such stories amongst my people. Being underground is just not for the Avariel...~ [AERIE18]
@1009086 = ~ You... might think it's silly, but at least in the daytime you can see what's coming!~ [AERIE19]
@1009088 = ~ My... my mother used to tell me such stories about the terrible things that came out in the night. But... oh, you must think me foolish...~ [AERIE20]
@1009097 = ~'Twas on a cold winter's night near the beginning of the Great Underwear Shortage that we set sail. I danced naked on the poop deck, which was the custom at the time. Well, my nose and other extremities were getting a bit frosty so I gathered up the tatters of my poor, abused, underwear and headed to the crow's nest.~ []
@1009113 = ~'Tis truly an adventure for the weak-willed. I've fought campaigns against the Hillgnasher giants, and slew twenty of the foul beasts.~ [ANOMEN53]
@1009130 = ~Haer'Dalis, a ronin, a rogue. You have more freedom than most and yet you remain as grumpy as a flea-bitten dog. Why so glum?~ [YOSHIM47]
@1009142 = ~Do not try my patience in this matter. We must rescue Imoen. Your family will wait.~ []
@1009149 = ~Mayhaps ye should, only 'Pleasures of the Dwarven Bed-Chamber' is a more pleasing and accurate subject.~ []
@1009152 = ~Most Holy Paladin, vengeance of the righteous gods, you are a married man are you not? What of your family? I have never heard you speak of them.~ [YOSHIM49]
@1009154 = ~Truly, I am married. I have a beautiful wife and two daughters. They are the joy of my life.~ [KELDOR64]
@1009160 = ~One must maintain constant discipline and remember the four principles of virtue... that is my motto and everlasting burden.~ [KELDOR55]
@1009168 = ~Never speak of my wife, gnome. Your lack of respect is appalling.~ []
@1009186 = ~Haer'Dalis, Haer'Dalis, you think too much and smile too little! Come, my bullywug! Come, my puss 'n' boots! We are in Athkatla, the city of a million smiling faces!~ [YOSHIM50]

@1009208 = ~Excuse me, good gnome.  I have a question that I've been meaning to ask for some time. These flash-bombs of yours...~ [YOSHIM51]
@1009209 = ~Yoshimo! Please! 'Jan Jansen's Flasher Master Bruiser Mate'. They have a name!~ [JANJAN57]
@1009211 = ~Of course. These 'Bruiser Mates' that you construct... might I learn how to use them?~ []
@1009216 = ~Mmm... perhaps I shall wait to perform such a feat. This... bomb... looks most unstable. I am surprised they do not explode in your pack, good gnome...~ []
@1009218 = ~I meant no disparagement, Jan... but I think I'll leave the bombing to you, for now.~ []
@1009222 = ~... Good, good, that's good to hear. And Leona, the boys are letting you play with them now? They're not teasing you anymore?~ []
@1009228 = ~Well, mageling, how goes the battle against all that is right and good in the world?~ [JANJAN52]
@1009230 = ~I sometimes believe that it is my destiny to become a part of some incompetent mage's fizzled schemes. Golodon the Unmanned being a case in point. You, too, I suppose.~ []

@1009233 = ~Cernd! You... you have been away some time. Much has changed.~ []
@1009238 = ~Truth be told, I feel a bit sorry for you. It must be frustrating to see your entire life's goals amount to absolutely nothing.~ []
@1009239 = ~What about me... what about my heart, Keldorn? What if I don't love you anymore?~ [MARIAX08]
@1009244 = ~Yes, Cernd, but Gragus has been... replaced. Faldorn is the new leader's name, and none have dared challenge her as yet.~ []
@1009249 = ~She is a Shadow Druid, and very... violent. She also... bonded with the grove. She is invulnerable outside of challenges, and those must be one-on-one battles.~ []
@1009254 = ~Well, well, look who has come from the sheltered north to join his brothers in the trenches. Tell me, Cernd, are you here to lecture us?~ []
@1009256 = ~I'm open to all creative muses. Lately I've been working on a turnip peeler. A magical device, of course, designed to peel a hundred turnips per minute. I'm really quite close to a breakthrough. Naturally, however, it does cost well over a hundred gold pieces per day to run. But think of the uses!~ [JANJAN58]
@1009260 = ~Exactly! You've got a knack for logical thinking, Yoshi. You could go far in the service of Gond.~ []
@1009263 = ~... Go--Go to your daughters. To look at you right now, Maria... To look at you is to go mad.~ []
@1009266 = ~Curse the dictates of honor! ... Oh, the very gods demand that I bring this case before the courts. Sir William shall be hung and the love of my entire life imprisoned. There is no other outcome.~ [KELDOR92]
@1009268 = ~Boo says that Yoshimo did well, too... for someone who isn't Minsc.~ []
@1009269 = ~I give you fair warning, interloper, that this area is under the protection of the druids of Tethir, and if you do not leave you will face nature's wrath!~ []
@1009276 = ~Tell me, Edwina, would you like me to let out the seams on your robe? I am quite handy with a needle. You do, after all, have more, uh... bulk... in the upper chest area.~ [YOSHIM54]
@1009300 = ~I would become a blood-soaked beast and damn my soul to the Abyss. You mean well... but it is not an option.~ []
@1009303 = ~Come, I know of him and he is often at the Mithrest in Waukeen's Promenade... let us go and see what sense we can make of this.~ []
@1009305 = ~I love you like I love the Church but the Church is the harsher taskmaster... we knew that when we married.~ []
@1009310 = ~Faldorn! I know of her! She was a Shadow Druid I met near the Cloakwood Mines of Baldur's Gate!~ []
@1009312 = ~So you follow her regardless? Certainly you cannot condone her actions?~ []
@1009314 = ~I have not followed her orders as she might have wished. If I had, you and I would not be speaking. I warn people away when I can but I am not skilled enough to openly oppose her.~ []
@1009315 = ~You have spoken with Cernd? I had hoped he or another would be sent to help. He serves the Grand Druid in the north. He will know what to do with this Faldorn.~ []
@1009319 = ~Backing down from a fight then? I think you should learn not to make threats you cannot enforce!~ []
@1009322 = ~Quiet! Oh... damn it all, they've heard. Others do not stop to chat. Do not say I didn't warn you. I gave you a chance, but no, you wanted to butt heads. So be it, I tried.~ []
@1009324 = ~Then you might end this! We have not experienced a Shadow Druid before; we are not strong enough to defeat her. I... I must go; she would harshly punish treachery.~ []
@1009329 = ~Dalok, what is the meaning of this?~ []
@1009332 = ~A Shadow Druid! They are perversions of our calling!~ []
@1009336 = ~Some obey out of fear but, I think her way is better. We fight for nature and take what we wish from the city fools. I will stop your feeble attempt to interfere, Cernd!~ []
@1009362 = ~Doppelganger~ []
@1009363 = ~Doppelganger~ []
@1009364 = ~Greater Doppelganger~ []
@1009365 = ~Greater Doppelganger~ []
@1009551 = ~DWARVES:  Dwarves are short stocky fellows, easily identifiable by their size and shape. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair. Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work, and care little for most humor. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, but most of all, they love gold. Dwarves have a natural resistance to magic and poison. They possess infravision, which allows them to see in the dark. They gain a bonus to their constitution, but incur a penalty to their charisma and dexterity.   There are four racial divisions of dwarves within the Realms:  Shield dwarves, Gold dwarves, Wild dwarves, and Duergar.~ []
@1009552 = ~ELVES:  Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than normal humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing,  frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. Elves have a natural resistance to charm and sleep magics. They can see in the dark with infravision, and they are very skilled in the use of the bow and long sword, receiving a +1 bonus on their To Hit rolls with them. Elves have a bonus to their dexterity, but incur a penalty to their constitution.  There are five racial divisions of elves within the Realms:  Gold elves, Moon elves, Wild elves, Sea elves, and Drow.~ []
@1009553 = ~GNOMES:  Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Most have dark tan or brown skin, white hair, and rather large noses. Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a love for nature that is only matched by their love for gems and jewelry. Gnomes have natural resistance to magic. They can see in the dark with infravision. They gain a bonus to their intelligence scores, but incur a penalty to their wisdom.~ []
@1009554 = ~HALFLINGS:  Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad, and often quite florid. Their hair is typically curly, and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun tales. Halflings are highly resistant to poisons and magic. They are naturally skilled with slings as weapons, receiving a +1 bonus on their To Hit rolls with them, and have a limited ability to see in the dark. They receive a bonus to their dexterity, and incur a penalty to their strength. There are three racial divisions of halflings within the Realms: the Hairfoot, Tallfellow, and Stout.~ []
@1009556 = ~FIGHTER:  The fighter is a champion, duelist, soldier, and brawler, who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good fighter needs to be strong and healthy to survive.~ []
@1009557 = ~RANGER: The ranger is a warrior of the woods, skilled with weapons and knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.~ []
@1009558 = ~PALADIN:  A paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true. Like the fighter, the paladin is a champion of battle. However, the paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry, striving to be a living example of these virtues so that others might learn and benefit from the paladin's actions.~ []
@1009559 = ~CLERIC: The cleric is a priest, of any mythos, who tends to the spiritual needs of a community as both protector and healer. The cleric is not purely defensive, however, and is well-suited to seek out and destroy threats when they arise.~ []
@1009560 = ~DRUID: Like the cleric, the druid is a priest, but for the ethos of nature and neutrality in the temple of the wilderness. The druid's special powers are devoted to the protection of the natural order and the preservation of balance in the world.~ []
@1009561 = ~THIEF: Cunning, nimbleness and stealth are the hallmarks and means to an end for this skilled pilferer. Whether these talents are turned against innocent passers-by and honest merchants, or oppressors and monsters, is a choice for the thief to make.~ []
@1009562 = ~BARD: The bard is also a rogue, but a very different one from the thief. The bard's strength is a pleasant and charming personality. With charm and wit is the bard's way made through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore, who learns a little bit about everything; a bard is a is a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.~ []
@1009563 = ~MAGE:  The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, the mage studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Only the most powerful are ever seen adventuring without a retinue of warriors and other partisans. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The mage can study all types of magic and learn the widest variety of spells, or choose to specialize, but will always have a broad enough range to be well-suited to the demands of adventuring.~ []
@1009565 = ~CONJURER:  A mage that specializes in creating useful creatures and objects.

Opposition School:  Divination~ []
@1009572 = ~FIGHTER/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a thief and a fighter, though they cannot use their thieving skills while wearing armor other than leather, studded leather or elven chainmail.~ []
@1009573 = ~FIGHTER/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and a cleric, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~ []
@1009574 = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and a mage, though they cannot cast spells while wearing armor other then elven chainmail. Gnomes can choose this multi-class, but become fighter/illusionists by default. Gnomes are the only race that can combine a specialist mage class in a multi-class.~ []
@1009575 = ~MAGE/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a mage and a thief, though they will not be able to cast spells while wearing armor other than elven chainmail.~ []
@1009576 = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter, mage, and thief. They cannot use their thieving skills while wearing armor other than leather, studded leather or elven chainmail, and cannot cast spells while wearing any armor other than elven chainmail.~ []
@1009577 = ~MAGE/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a mage and a cleric, though they will not be able to cast mage spells while wearing armor other then elven chainmail.~ []
@1009578 = ~THIEF/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a thief and cleric, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~ []
@1009579 = ~FIGHTER/ DRUID:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and druid, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the druid's ethos (scimitar, dagger, club, spear, quarterstaff, dart and sling.)~ []
@1009580 = ~CLERIC/ RANGER:  This character can use the abilities of a cleric and ranger, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~ []
@1009581 = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter, mage, and cleric, though they cannot cast mage spells while wearing any armor other than elven chainmail, and are restricted to weapons allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~ []
@1009582 = ~STRENGTH:  Strength measures a character's muscle, endurance, and stamina. It is the prime requisite of fighters.
Minimum: <MINIMUM>
Maximum: <MAXIMUM>~ []
@1009588 = ~You have been given proficiencies to start your character with. These represent the ability to effectively use weapons. You may choose from any of the selectable proficiencies available to your character class. A fighter character will be able to choose the same proficiency up to five times. This will grant additional levels of specialization with the weapon listed. Keep in mind that a character can use any weapon available to their race and class whether proficient with it or not. However, there will be a minus to the attack roll if the character attacks with a non-proficient weapon.

Proficiency Slot Table:
1 slot: none
2 slots: +1 to hit, +2 to damage, an extra half attack.
3 slots: +2 to hit, +2 to damage, an extra half attack.
4 slots: +2 to hit, +3 to damage, an extra half attack. -1 to speed
5 slots: +2 to hit, +4 to damage, an extra half attack. -3 to speed~ []
@1009591 = ~BOW:  This weapon class allows the character to use Long bows, Composite Long bows, and Short bows. Only Fighters, Rangers, and Paladins can use the Composite Long bow. Thieves can choose this category, but are restricted to Short Bows only.~ []
@1009598 = ~OPEN LOCKS (Thievery):  A thief uses this ability to pick pad locks, door locks and combination locks.~ []
@1009603 = ~LAWFUL GOOD:  Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society with a well-organized government can work to make life better for the majority of the people. To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed. When people respect the laws and try to help one another, society as a whole prospers. Therefore, lawful good characters strive for those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the most people and cause the least harm. An honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and wise king, or a stern but forthright minister of justice are all examples of lawful good people.~ []
@1009604 = ~LAWFUL NEUTRAL: Order and organization are of paramount importance to characters of this alignment. They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether that government is a tyranny or benevolent democracy. The benefits of organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by their actions. An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of lawful neutral behavior.~ []
@1009606 = ~NEUTRAL GOOD:  These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the concerns of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good. Since the universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it may even maintain it. If fostering good means supporting organized society, then that is what must be done. If good can only come about through the overthrow of existing social order, so be it. Social structure itself has no innate value to them. A baron who violates the orders of his king to destroy something he sees as evil is an example of a neutral good character.~ []
@1009607 = ~NEUTRAL EVIL: Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and their own advancement. They have no particular objection to working with others or, for that matter, going it on their own. Their only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy way to gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously illegal, they take advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters, they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions for personal gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays people to the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical examples of neutral evil characters.~ []
@1009608 = ~NEUTRAL: True neutral characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and they refuse to see actions as either good or evil. Since the majority of people in the world make judgments, true neutral characters are extremely rare. True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the forces of either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their duty to see that all of these forces remain in balanced contention. True neutral characters sometimes find themselves forced into rather peculiar alliances. To a great extent, they are compelled to side with the underdog in any given situation, sometimes even changing sides as the previous loser becomes the winner. A true neutral druid might join the local barony to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop out or switch sides when the gnolls were brought to the brink of destruction. He would seek to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Clearly, there are very few true neutral characters in the world.~ []
@1009610 = ~CHAOTIC NEUTRAL: Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.~ []
@1009611 = ~CHAOTIC EVIL: These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized. Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for themselves. The strong have the right to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by a desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies. Such a group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of bullying his underlings into obedience. Since leadership is based on raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.~ []

@1009703 = ~Nalia Abducted By Isaea Roenall

@1009728 = ~You sting me, but I shall let it pass. I enjoy seeing anger in you... it shows promise. We Drow make few apologies for the way we are, and I make no promises.~ []

@1009732 = ~Not now... tell me some other time, perhaps.~ []
@1009735 = ~Lolth had abandoned me, and I was alone in a strange world. Those rivvin who saw me hounded me with abandon, and I fled to the forests.~ []

@1009742 = ~You've a flair for melodrama, Viconia. But I'm losing interest... tell it to someone else.~ []
@1009751 = ~'At's alright then. You just watch your step and such.~ []
@1009752 = ~Hey, you look like you're a bit important. Like you're a bit tough and such. You got any... ah... special things you need taken care of?~ []
@1009766 = ~I don't know what you are talkin'... I... I ain't done anything wrong! I'm just a simple gravekeeper, ain't no crime here!~ []

@1009774 = ~Tell me... has there ever been anyone special to you? A thief of your heart?~ [VICONI76]
@1009781 = ~No? Is it not possible then? Could she exist: a woman who makes your pulse quicken by her closeness... who enflames you by a mere glance?~ []
@1009784 = ~You think so? I cannot wait for the final act of this play, then... I am sure it will be worth waiting for.~ []
@1009786 = ~When the heart beats true, its song is a delight to hear.~ []
@1009787 = ~Your heart is heavy with lust and burning desire, and beats proudly and strongly... but shall it be mine or is it another's?~ []

@1009812 = ~It would be nice, wouldn't it <CHARNAME>? To leave the insidious schemes and psychopathic madmen for others to battle and prevail over?~ []
@1009813 = ~You could leave this wretched excuse for a life anytime, Viconia.~ []
@1009819 = ~I will definitely consider its value and place in my life, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate your words of friendship, as well... it is not words I am familiar with.~ []

@1009829 = ~Of course I have. Who doesn't?~ []

@1009865 = ~Why are druids attacking all who enter the wood? This is not our role! Where is the balance in this?~ []

@1009918 = ~There's a WHAT in their chicken?

A farmer named Jeb told me that the Hendricks... fellow farmers who have fled from the outlying lands into Imnesvale... may have put something down the gullets of one of their chickens, something that their adventuring daughter brought home with her before she died. Considering the Hendricks went through that much effort to hide it, it may be something quite valuable.~ []
@1009938 = ~Please disregard the things I said to you earlier. They were ill-conceived. You... you are not drow and not worthy of such insults.~ [VICONI80]

After a difficult battle, the keep of Nalia's family has finally been cleared of its troll invaders.

@1010128 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

I encountered a friend of Valygar's, a ranger by the name of Suna Seni. She told me a little of the man... he is a ranger, for starters, and belongs to a family that is under some kind of curse. He is fairly wealthy, having a home in the Docks District and some wild land out in the Umar Hills.

@1010185 = ~When asked about his past, MINSC proclaims that he is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen in the utter east, though his affinity for animals speaks to his skill as a ranger as well. He originally came to the Sword Coast on a dajemma, a ritual journey to manhood, as the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rashemen named Dynaheir. To his shame, Dynaheir is now dead, and he fears that the doors of the honored Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge are forever closed to him. This personal tragedy has obviously not strengthened Minsc's hold on reality, as evidenced by his continued dependence on his animal companion 'Boo', a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist somewhere in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head.~ []
@1010206 = ~When asked about his past, XAN wistfully speaks of his home in the elven stronghold of Evereska, and his role as a Greycloak. It was apparently decreed that he was to investigate the events of the iron shortage, determine who or what were the causes, and ascertain whether there was a greater threat to the region as a whole. This was definitely not a small task, and he accepted the responsibility with a great deal of dread. You get the feeling, however, that he approaches everything with a great deal of dread. He has devoted his life to improving his mastery of magic and has become a skilled wizard, though this dedication has left him little time to make friends or acquire any other pastimes. He strikes you as very capable, though probably not the best influence on morale.~ []

She has continued in her worship of the Night Goddess Shar, but that appears to have been the only boon to her exile. She seems sullen and bitter, and has certainly learned much of the intolerance she must face while living amongst surface peoples.

Level: 3

Area of Effect: The caster

This spell is similar to its level 6 counterpart Spell Deflection, which causes single-target spells cast against the wizard (except for Breach and Lower Resistance) to be absorbed and consumed. Minor Spell Deflection affects a total of 4 spell levels, including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excluding area effect spells.

The Finger of Death spell snuffs out its victim's life force. The caster points his or her finger at the target after the incantation is complete, effectively ripping the life out of the target's body unless a save vs. spells is made at -2 penalty.

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell causes confusion in all creatures within the area of effect, rendering them indecisive and unable to act effectively, unless a saving throw vs. spells is made at a -2 penalty.

Magically confused creatures will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~ []

Area of Effect: 60 degree arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his or her fingertips.

Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell is lucky in everything that he does for the next 3 rounds and receives a bonus to any of his actions. This includes saving throws, to hit chances, etc. This means that dice rolls are raised by 5% of their maximum value, although a die roll will not be raised above the highest value normally possible for it, so that, for example, a roll of 18 on a twenty-sided die would be raised to 19, a 19 would be raised to 20 but a 20 would remain a 20.~

When a wizard casts a Sleep spell, he causes a comatose slumber to come upon all creatures with the area of effect (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). All creatures to be affected by the sleep spell must be within 30 feet of each other. Creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw at a -3 penalty or fall asleep. Monsters with 4+3 Hit Dice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more are unaffected. The center of the area of effect is determined by the spellcaster. Magically sleeping opponents can be attacked with substantial bonuses.~ []

Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 2-foot by 60-foot jet
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be hit by the flame for 3-18 points of damage. There is no saving throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as fire resistance will apply, and may reduce or eliminate the damage. Other creatures who cross the path of the flame jet will also take damage.~ []

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2 

A fireball is an explosive burst of flame which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage relative to the level of the wizard who cast it (1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster, up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit, and unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throw suffer full damage from the blast. Those who save successfully manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, and receive half damage.~ []
@1012180 = ~Magic Missile (Evocation)

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience beyond the first level, the wizard gains an additional missile: he or she has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, and a maximum of five missiles at 9th level.~ []
@1012181 = ~Stinking Cloud (Evocation) 
Level: 2
Range: 30 yards 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

When a Stinking Cloud is cast, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 30 yards away from his or her position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be sent reeling and fall down for 1-2 rounds. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A dispel magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud then they are still subject to its effects.~ []
@1012185 = ~Animate Dead (Necromancy) 
Level: 5
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: 8 hours 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes 1-2 undead monsters to rise and serve the wizard under any conditions. One undead servant automatically rises, and there is a 5% chance per level of the caster that another will rise and join the first. However, at 15th level the caster will be able to summon a single Skeleton Warrior, a very powerful ally indeed. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or turned, or until 8 hours pass.~ []

@1012200 = ~Glyph of Warding (Abjuration, Evocation) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian 
Range: 20 yards
Duration: Permanent until discharged 
Casting Time: Special 
Area of Effect: 12-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. 

Any creature violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.

When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When the glyph is activated, it deals 1-4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster to the victim.~

Furthermore, the target receives a +1 bonus to all saving throws except saves vs. spells. Multiple castings of Barkskin are not cumulative.~ []

@1012212 = ~Call Lightning (Alteration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Weather
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn/ 4 levels
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 360-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

When a call lightning spell is cast, it must be cast outside, otherwise it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn. The spell has a duration of one turn for every four levels of the caster. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 8th-level caster will call down two bolts, each doing 10d8 (2d8 + 8d8) damage.

The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies. The first enemy struck by the lightning will be the enemy targeted. After that any enemy (but not allies) may be struck by the ensuing lightning storm.~

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures and any saving throw rolls they make against fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage dice rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 30 feet) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~
@1012217 = ~Chant (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

By means of the chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party, and causes harm to his enemies. When the chant spell is completed, all attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, while those of the priest's enemies suffer -1 penalties. However, these bonuses and penalties will not raise or lower dice rolls above or below their usual boundaries. For example, a damage roll of 6 on 1d8 for a successful attack made by an affected ally will be raised to a 7, a 7 will be raised to an 8, but an 8 will remain an 8. Other bonuses may still raise total damage above 8, however. Multiple chants are not cumulative.~

Duration: Instant
Casting time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 

A Know Alignment spell enables the priest to read the aura of a creature. The caster must remain stationary and concentrate on the subject for a full round.

@1012223 = ~Charm Person or Mammal (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Sphere: Animal 
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal 
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect (with a +3 modifier), with any adjustment due to Wisdom.

If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.

If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.

Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he was charmed.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By calling upon his deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer. For the duration of the spell, the priest may use the magic weapon without a non-proficiency penalty. It strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 to hit and damage for every six experience levels of the spellcaster, up to a maximum of +3 for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4 + 1, plus the magical bonus).~ []

Level: 2
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains the benefits similar to those of a bless spell (+1 to attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws -- these benefits stack with those of the bless spell) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic. Example: A 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 3 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 4 normal hit points and all 3 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.~

@1013137 = ~History of Calimshan:  

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air. 

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire. Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there. Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old. 

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places - Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr - took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe. 

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change. As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born. It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the Forgotten Realms. Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn. The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere. 

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim.  A force that great, they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the Realms, and that didn't happen. Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir). 

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to soley dominate the land. There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its power over its own area. About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land. Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do. The oldest son of each Pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one. The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~ []
@1013138 = ~History of Cormyr:  

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line. 

The land has been officially at peace for many years - since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east. One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy."  In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.~ []
@1013140 = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:  

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history. Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin. When Raurin fell in 2488DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia. Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged. Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy. All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity. Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life. Merchants were honored above all. In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants. During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the Council of Merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries. War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement. During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed. Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath. The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every ablebodied fighting man they sent. The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts. He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time. He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things. He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade. He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems. He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life. Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range. They roamed as far east as Kara Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa. At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zaakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~ []
@1013143 = ~History of Halruaa:   

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert. The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netheril, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe. It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow. The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times. Once, led by a magic resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa. They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader. Forty-thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by 500 Halruans. More than 200 Halruan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle. 

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than 100 years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power hungry king of Lapaliiya. He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships. The attackers were easily routed. 

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netheril didn't approve of. The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa. 

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruans very defensive, warlike and traditional. The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.~ []
@1013146 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshall of the Twisted Tower:  

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshall of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; however, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~ []
@1013148 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre: 

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale. All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home. A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs. During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll. Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale. The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune. Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.~ []
@1013150 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, Lord Aumry's widow, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.~ []
@1013151 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Khelben Kills Jyordhan: 

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~ []
@1013152 = ~History of Shadowdale - Lords Accepted by Acclamation: 

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff. Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large. This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well. They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster). The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.~ []
@1013153 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords: 

 During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (widow of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~ []
@1013154 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale: 

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well.

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there was little validity to the claim.~ []
@1013155 = ~History of Shadowdale - Elminster Moves to Shadowdale: 

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area. A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement. The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes. The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.~ []
@1013157 = ~History of Shadowdale - Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry: 

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon. The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale). Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym. The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale. Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule. This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.~ []
@1013158 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped. The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender. Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan. While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR). When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle. In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters. 

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old. By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community. Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his maturity, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name. If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.~ []
@1013159 = ~History of Tethyr: 

For the past 1,500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power. When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne. As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne. Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so). 

The established recurring cycle was broken 10 years ago. The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr. King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr. Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well. Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies. Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury. These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change. 

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however; it takes treachery as well. In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and an impatient royal heir. Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army. While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile. By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help. 

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates. At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father. A fire set by the elite troops would destroy evidence of treachery; the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government. 

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point. Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire. At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid. 

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family. Once Castle Tethyr began to fall there was no holding back the mob. In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin. Everything of value - fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust. 

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos. In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword. This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding." 

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell. Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived. These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr. 

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted. "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society. The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~ []
@1013160 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:  

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was a great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command of the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races. However, these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep - its slender, now-broken spires - can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~ []
@1013164 = ~History of the Dragon Coast:  

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin. Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day. 

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall. It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south. And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power. 

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate. The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords. His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast - corruption and treachery. 

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR. Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated.~ []
@1013165 = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:  

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "Elves of the South," before this crucial event. Even then they were known as "Dark Elves," for the hue of their skins. They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South. A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes. Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them. 

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered. This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~ []
@1013168 = ~History of the Last March of the Giants: 

 East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerun, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion. The powers then dropped a star onto the land. The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars. Slowly picking up speed, the ball rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south. 

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks. The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths. The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemminglike, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again. 

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future. They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~ []
@1013185 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:  

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked - Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day. 

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land - freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental, Summoning 
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting a conjure earth elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the elemental plane of Earth, and an earth elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. It is 60% likely that a 12 hit dice elemental appears, 35% likely that a 16 hit dice elemental appears, and 5% likely that a 24 hit dice elemental appears. All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. Priests do not have to engage in a battle of the wits to control their summoned elemental (unlike mages). The elemental will remain under the caster's control until slain or until the spell duration expires.~

The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain, or the duration of the spell runs out. All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and no need to know the language of the summoned creature.

I have met Valygar Corthala in his cabin in the Umar Hills, hiding away from the Cowled Wizards who are hunting him. According to Valygar, he is related to Lavok, an ancient necromancer who built the sphere five hundred years before... a sphere that disappeared shortly after it was completed and has just re-appeared. The Cowled Wizards seem sure that Valygar is the key to accessing the place, the reason for their harassment of him.

I have let Valygar go his own way, but he cannot stay any longer at the cabin now that it has been compromised. He told me that if I should have need of him in the future, I can find him through his servant at his home in the Docks District in Athkatla.~ []

@1018973 = ~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 to 47 inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting. This particular blade hums slightly in your hand, the only overt evidence that magic runs through it.

Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This sword is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.

Jaheira's steadfast belief in her cause appears to have won the day. The Harpers have judged the matter closed and will not pursue me further... and on top of this, Jaheira has been given a Harper Pin, an honor that not all Harpers can claim.

@1020694 = ~Bodhi keeps her side of the bargain.

Bodhi agreed to fulfill our bargain, though there were some additional concerns she revealed.
According to Bodhi, Irenicus captured me because he had discovered my nature as a child of Bhaal, and he was attempting to 'aid' my development, though his methods were indistinguishable from torture. The Shadow Thieves attacked Irenicus before I could be told any of this, and I escaped as he was incarcerated.

Bodhi also told me that she is essentially Irenicus' sister, and that her reason for helping me is that she wishes to free the wizard from the same place that Imoen has been sent to, a dread asylum for magic-users called Spellhold. Bodhi does this not out of any familial attachment, but rather because she requires Irenicus for her own purposes. As added incentive she offers to reveal whatever Irenicus learned about me. 

The asylum is on an island under its own rule, and Bodhi used the gold I gave her to book passage for me. There I will try to find a way into Spellhold to free Imoen... and, Bodhi hopes, free Irenicus at the same time.~ []

@1021314 = ~Large Shield +2:
This dwarven-made shield was commissioned by Pellan of Tyr, a brash paladin known for unquestioning courage and an almost total lack of common sense. Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle. As it happened, Pellan and his armor digested readily enough, but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps. Subsequently coughed up, it lay in a hoard for years until retrieved by Pellan's son, a warrior who understood the virtues of sneaking. This shield's superior craftsmanship is supplemented by a permanent lightness spell, which makes the shield very easy to wield.

@1021333 = ~A large shield inlaid with a golden griffin. The body shield, also known as the kite or tower shield, is a massive wooden or metal shield extending from the chin to the toe of the user. It must be firmly fastened to the forearm, and the shield hand must firmly grip it at all times. Naturally, this precludes the use of the shield hand for anything but holding the body shield in place. Strangely enough, this shield feels unusually light for its size.

@1021957 = ~Bala's Axe - Wizard Slayer:
Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race, he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened by his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench which overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe gives the owner the ability to dispel magic once a day.

The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage. Actually, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful dispel magic.

The Knee-capper, or "The Capper," as it is affectionately known in dwarven circles, is rumored to have been forged by Clangeddin himself. He gave it to a small clan of homeless dwarves, that they might carve a place for themselves amongst the giants and ogres in their area. The hammer has been passed from hero to hero, occasionally finding its way into non-dwarven hands.

@1022311 = ~Polymorph Other (Alteration) 
Level: 4
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However, most physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This particular version of the spell will transform the recipient into a squirrel unless a save vs. petrification/polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until a Dispel Magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. All clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~ []

@1022322 = ~Polymorph Self (Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn + 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: self
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. This spell does not confer upon the wizard the new form's other abilities, such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality.

Once the spell is cast, the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as he wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases, and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistances to magic, missile and blunt weapons possessed by the slime form.

The possible forms afforded by polymorph self are:
(1) Gnoll: wields a magical halberd (+1 fire damage and strikes as an enchanted weapon +3)
(2) Mustard Jelly: capable of slowing opponents (if they fail Save vs. Spells when hit)
(3) Ogre: capable of causing massive damage with its fists

In addition the caster may choose the form of spider, brown bear, black bear or wolf.~ []

@1022560 = ~I'm willing to do the job... what was it again that you wanted me to do?~ []

@1022569 = ~I have found out what happened to him, yes. He was turned into a bird... which I have with me, here.~ []
@1022572 = ~That's right... find someone else to do your work for you. I tire of your attitude.~ []
@1022574 = ~Well, what are you waiting for?! Go and get that bird and bring it back to me? Bah... do I have to tell you everything?!~ []
@1022576 = ~That wasn't part of the deal... I found out what happened and I told you.~ []
@1022577 = ~Very well... I'll go and return with the bird.~ []
@1022579 = ~Finally Montaron will be returned to my side! This is excellent news... especially since some fools broke into my laboratory and slaughtered all my creations!~ []

@1022613 = ~Feeblemind (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg

Feeblemind causes the subject's intellect to degenerate into that of a simple beast of burden, setting his or her Intelligence to 3. The victim remains in this state until a successful Dispel Magic is cast upon him or her. The victim must make a save vs. spells at a -2 penalty in order to avoid the effect.~ []
@1022617 = ~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 5 foot radius around target
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds 1d4 creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place unless a save vs. spells is made at a -2 penalty. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster, and all creatures within 5 feet of the target are also affected. Those who succeed in their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~ []
@1022619 = ~Mental Domination (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Thought 
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg.

When cast upon a subject, he must make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty in order to avoid the priest entering his mind. The effects of this spell are similar to the wizard spell domination, with a few minor differences. Most notably, this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell duration. To control the subject, the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. This control will last until dispelled or for the duration of the spell.~

@1022688 = ~I have money, my dear. Take some of it and perhaps we'll... get better acquainted, yes?~ []
@1022689 = ~I know little about the thieves, my <LADYLORD>. They be all over the district... and the other women say you must never work for Mae'Var if you value your skin.~ []
@1022690 = ~You seem a woman of class, Altheia... how is it that you came to this life on the streets?~ []
@1022692 = ~I... I cannot! (sob!)  I cannot, sir! Forgive me, mother!~ []
@1022695 = ~It would seem that the very speculation of this weapon's existence has conspired to pull it from the realm of fantasy and into the everyday, though as with all things that come from dreams, it is not as it truly seems. The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; though not in the manner the finder might have hoped. It is rumored that the blade was actually constructed by vampires as a trap for those that might eventually oppose them. These incredibly clever fiends have apparently fashioned numerous versions of these unfortunate blades over time, and they are the bane of all right-thinking adventurers. Each swing actually inflicts damage upon the wielder, as his or her life energies are drained in order to heal the intended victim. Were this not enough, the weapon is cursed so as to prevent its removal, and such that the user is smitten with a wasting of the mind, so that he or she does not even think of trying to dispose of it. This blade may be among the few magical treasures that are simply not worth the trouble of seeking.

The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

Club +1, +3 vs. unnatural creatures
This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. Although civilized areas were affected considerably, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those who remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land, taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed upon the item its ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

Duration: 6 rounds

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

Defensive Harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by enhancing their coordination. This allows a group of creatures to act as a cohesive unit for a single battle or encounter. The effect is always centered on the caster, but affects all those within a 10 foot radius. The recipients of this enchantment can move outside of the initial area of effect after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of the harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +2 bonus to his or her armor class. Multiple castings of Defensive Harmony are not cumulative.~ []
@1022832 = ~Protection From Evil 10' Radius (Abjuration) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 10' radius are affected individually by 'protection from evil'. It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of - 2 to each attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~

@1022924 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Jaheira forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right... Amaunator's idol has restored Jaheira not only to life, but has removed the vampiric curse from her, as well.~ []
@1022928 = ~The return to Harper Hold.

I have rejoined with Jaheira at the Harper Hold... and she was happy to see me, relaying that the Harpers there were no longer truly Harpers. She is unaware of the full plot, but the lack of the specters on the second floor meant that this was a mere splinter group bent on revenge, and having killed them to free Jaheira from their clutches does not weigh on my heart.~ []
@1022935 = ~You're back... but you haven't completed the task, yet.~ []
@1022945 = ~Garren's child rescued.

Garren Windspear's child has been rescued and the dragon lies dead. Garren thanked me for all that I have done and offered his home as lodgings should I ever be in the Windspear Hills area again.~ []

@1023351 = ~Chapter 3

Throughout my time in Athkatla and my adventures in and around the city, I have seen hints of some great struggle between the Shadow Thieves and some other source. This other source approached me in the form of Bodhi... a woman of great power and evil, rivaling her ambition. She revealed the nature of my benefactors under Gaelan Bayle to be none other than the Shadow Thieves, themselves, and offered to give me the same help that they did... but at a far lesser price.

I have accepted Bodhi's offer and she has taken me into her confidence, for now. The true nature of her motivations has yet to be revealed, but it is obvious that Bodhi is on the winning side of this city-wide conflict. As to the gold I have given her for her aid... I have the feeling that it is just the beginning of the final price I will eventually have to pay. But I will have my answers... I will find Imoen and Irenicus both.~ []

@1023378 = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun. Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to augment the skill of the wielder.

Formerly

'A Lovely Bun-cake Brightens Anyone's Day'

The recipes herein are mine own imagining, and thus ingredients are subject to change as per my whim. 
-----------------
Belladonna Bun-cake
A simple little dish for a rainy afternoon.

Cornflour, 
The eggs of a seabird, 
A spoon of the Whitecap fungus,
The fruit of your choice for sweetening, 
One small measure of the belladonna root.
Prepare as one would a breadloaf, though less time given to the rising. 
Bake in a well stoked hearth under leaves for one turn of the hourglass.

Notes to myself: Refrain from eating this ever again. Exceptionally poisonous. Remember the unfortunate week on the kitchen floor. 
-----------------
Dradeel's Vegetable Surprise
A dish that turned out surprisingly edible. Not reccomended as the primary meal every day for 300 years. Some disorientation may result.

Place 2 cups of virgin Netherese Olive Oil and 1 large chopped onion in a large pot
Saute onions in oil over medium fire until onions begin to become clear
Add 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped stalks of celery
Saute for an additional 3 minutes
Add 1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a boil.

Add 2 diced and peeled potatoes, 1 cup of white wine (I find that a Myth Rhynnian vintage is perfect), 1 bay leaf, 2 diced tomatoes, and chopped parsley to taste.

Cook, covered, over medium-smallish fire until vegetables are almost tender. Add 2 cups of chopped spinach and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve hot and garnish with grated cheese.

Note: For orcish version, replace all ingredients with turnips.
-----------------
Curative Ingredients for the Dispelling of Lycanthropy. 
Mother's family recipe

Notes: Mother's topical salve is a rather large failure. Research further with the following in mind: The creatures on this isle are unusual beyond their splitting into two factions. Theirs is an odd curse, one that defies the traditional remedies (such as the unfortunately dangerous muffins previous), though one is not without hope. The exotic origin of the original stock suggest a unique enchantment, not unlike that of the more widely know vampiric afflictions. The casual bite might be averted using such things as the Belladonna flower, but an intentional infection could actually require the extermination of the leader of the clan. This is merely conjecture of course, as I have been unable to examine said leader. Despite my strange immunity, his is a strength that could still inflict a measure of serious damage upon my physical form. He and I have spoken on occasion, though his tolerance of me is no more resilient than mine is of him. 

Further notes to myself: Future offerings of peace to either of the wolven clans should not take the form of muffins of any sort.

The Bachelor's Crutch
Noodles of quality and convenience.

With both Lord de'Arnise and Nalia dead, none of her family are left to carry on the keep... and without one of them alive, killing TorGal and routing his forces was a pointless victory. Fortunately, Nalia's body remains in my possession and I have been asked to raise her as soon as possible.~ []

He also said I might look into Isaea's records at his home just northwest of the government building in the Government District.

Valygar's quest is finally done. Lavok was not what he expected, and has caused the normally judgmental ranger to think deeply about what he has experienced.

@1024247 = ~Whatever the reason, they are here. I am sorry, but I don't know numbers or tactics; I only know that we must get rid of them... we must rescue my family, that is all.~ []
@1024248 = ~You'll have to sneak in and rescue someone. Perhaps... oh, what's his name... Daleson, the servant that tended the stables. He might be in there. Will you find him?~ []
@1024251 = ~I had no interest in you before, and I have no interest in you now.~ []
@1024258 = ~We need more information. If we march through the front door it will be a slaughter.~ []

@1024261 = ~Perhaps... oh, what's his name... Daleson! He worked in the stables. They may have left him to tend the animals for food. He would know! He might be inside.~ []
@1024269 = ~But you have come all this way... No, if you do not wish to help then I will not ingratiate myself further. I see quite enough of that from the nobles around here.~ []
@1024270 = ~Is it cowardly to live through the day? You can certainly storm the front gates if you like, but what happens to my family when the trolls realize you are there?~ []
@1024286 = ~Enter north of the palisade, though a secret door along the wall of the keep. I used it to sneak out at night. Aunty never approved, but I didn't care.~ []
@1024288 = ~Is it cowardly to live through the day? We can storm the front gates if you like, but what happens when the trolls realize we are there?~ []
@1024292 = ~I can't go another step without knowing who we face. I will not go blind into this.~ []
@1024293 = ~We need more information. A frontal assault would be a slaughter.~ []
@1024294 = ~We don't know how many they have, or even if there is anyone left alive to rescue.~ []
@1024331 = ~Yes, my friend. I thank you again for your support. I suggest that we seek out the Temple Superior, Overgold Renwellyn. We've no proof of Barl's guilt other than Wallace's word and my suspicions.~ []
@1024339 = ~Why no, I've seen them just this week. I expect wedding bells'll be comin' for the two of them.~ []
@1024347 = ~Shut up and listen, old man. We know your buddy Barl's been poisoning people and we're gonna kill him. Where is he?~ []
@1024350 = ~I assure you this is true. Barl supplies Wallace, a local merchant, with potions... and one of those potions poisoned Mazzy's sister.~ []
@1024360 = ~What? But I just joined... oh, very well. I can't wait around for you though. I have to go to my family's land and help them. If you still want to help then that's where you should go. I'll meet you there and we can plan the attack.~ [NALIA97]
@1024364 = ~I have no intention of helping you. Get someone else.~ []
@1024375 = ~But... but we've been together such a short while. Please, do you still intend to help me defend my family's keep?~ [NALIA93]
@1024376 = ~Please, you did promise. We need to go to my family's land and join the defense. If you have changed your mind, please tell me.~ [NALIA69]
@1024387 = ~You could have said earlier! I need to be there! They may already be... Goodbye and thanks for nothing!~ []
@1024389 = ~We must get to Daleson soon. They may kill him, and then we'll have no idea what we're up against! He should be inside next to the secret door.~ [NALIA71]
@1024390 = ~Now, there be a vital gem nestled within the stench of this place... in an altar, I believe. Mekrath took it from me and I must have it back. Come, let us retrieve it before we venture further.~ []
@1024392 = ~Mekrath has stolen an important gem from my keeping and locked it away within an altar in this lair. Find it and I shall stand guard over ye mewling babes 'til we return to Raelis.~ []
@1024409 = ~You want fight Gorf? Hah, hah, hah!~ []
@1024414 = ~Ugh, that much good. Gorf ready to fight, pit man!~ []
@1024423 = ~How dishonorable! The boorishness of the large people never ceases to amaze me.~ [MAZZY84]
@1024425 = ~You told him, Mazzy!~ []
@1024435 = ~We need comrades, not servants, Haer'Dalis. What skills do you bring with you?~ []
@1024447 = ~It'll do... Welcome to the group, Haer'Dalis.~ []
@1024450 = ~More than enough, Haer'Dalis, more than enough. My apologies for doubting you.~ []
@1024452 = ~It is mine and I was on my way to deliver it to Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe when he captured me. Come, let us find it that Ms. Shai may reward us both for its safe delivery.~ []
@1024453 = ~I don't believe that it's any of your business, hound. Now may I join you or is this meeting over?~ []
@1024455 = ~You're right: This meeting's over.~ []
@1024456 = ~Of that, you have my word... Come, my late but unmourned captor has hidden a gem in an altar, here. It is imperative that I return it to Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe and soon. You have my assurance that her reward shall be generous.~ []
@1024458 = ~A word to the wise, however: it is best you come to her with gifts. I had a gem that would have served the purpose nicely but the late Mekrath saw fit to steal it from my hands. It is in an altar in this place... I strongly recommend you take it with you.~ []
@1024468 = ~Very well, Haer'Dalis. Friendship... Welcome aboard.~ []
@1024473 = ~I believe the jewel lies within an altar, here... If we can find the jewel and complete the delivery, then I shall place myself at your every command.~ []
@1024476 = ~If you find it, I ask that you deliver it to the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe where I will be waiting. I will see to it that my mistress rewards you greatly. Now fare thee well, my hounds of rescue, for time is short.~ []
@1024484 = ~This is the second half of the Rift Device Rod. The completed Rod may be used for the destruction of the Unseeing Eye.~ []
@1024485 = ~The mysterious Rift Device. 
This rod is said to be so destructive that it was cursed by the gods and buried deep within the Earth. The ancient god Amaunator and his worshippers were charged with the task of guarding it. Amaunator's fading Avatar has allowed you to use it with the expressed purpose of destroying the Unseeing Eye. The Avatar asked that you return it when your task is done, as it would be exceptionally dangerous to bring this device above ground.~ []
@1024487 = ~If we can find it, a certain Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe shall reward us greatly for its return. Come, let us search for it and be done with these wretched airs.~ []
@1024491 = ~Should you find it, I ask that you deliver it to me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe. I will see to it that my mistress rewards you greatly.~ []
@1024494 = ~You wound me... 'twas a simple verse. You think, mayhap, that my brain has been addled too long by arcane spells? Oh, what tragedy!~ []
@1024498 = ~ You can... feel the wrongness in such a place. It has seeped into the very rocks, themselves.~ [MAZZY18]
@1024515 = ~Mekrath has given you to me fairly... your only other choice would have been to remain a mindless slave.~ []
@1024516 = ~I'm from Imnesvale in the Umar Hills. People h-have been disappearing. Some of them have t-t-turned up, but they're all turned inside-out and mad.~ []
@1024526 = ~I suppose such actions are the only means of raising your status, but I still want your tromping about in these halls kept to a minimum. Delousing will interfere with my social schedule.~ []
@1024528 = ~Obviously those filthy creatures have swung the doors wide to any common traveler. You do look somewhat different than the fiends that entrapped me.~ []
@1024529 = ~Nalia sent you, didn't she? Only she would know where to get such ruffians. Consorting with servants will leave her dead like her softhearted mother, earning a virulent fever for her charitable excesses.~ []
@1024530 = ~I have a hazy recollection of it being in an altar, here... but should you ever find it, I know an actress of the Sigil theater troupe, Raelis Shai, who would pay a fine reward to any who might bring it to her.~ []
@1024534 = ~I must find it again so it may be returned to its rightful owner, Miss Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe... Your help in this would mean a million worlds to me.~ []
@1024535 = ~Your friend Mekrath stole from me a certain gem that I must have back. If you can find it in this place... in an altar, if I remember right... please bring it to me at the playhouse. You will not go unrewarded.~ []
@1024540 = ~The gem is in an altar, here... so let's return it and reap a good reward. So put aside your illusions of grandeur for a while and help me find the blasted thing before Mekrath comes back.~ []
@1024541 = ~I suppose I should expect nothing less. Your lack of breeding is apparent in your close-set eyes. Loot as you will, but you will not get the satisfaction of a fearful response from me.~ []
@1024543 = ~I think you should be afraid. I do not keep baggage for no purpose. Prepare to die.~ []
@1024544 = ~Do, as you will. I will not lose my dignity just because you threaten my life. Indeed, I would rather die than lose respect for myself. Frankly, I don't know how you peasants stand it.~ []
@1024548 = ~... until yon mage cast me into bondage, of course. Miss Shai will reward you greatly for the jewel, of that I have no doubt. So come, I believe it lays in an altar here... let us find it 'ere the wizard returns.~ []
@1024550 = ~'Twas mine before my capture and I was delivering it to Raelis Shai, the Mistress of the Sigil theater troupe. I do not doubt that she would still reward us greatly for its delivery. Come, let us find it and be gone from here before the wizard fool returns.~ []
@1024554 = ~Do you now? Perhaps you are unsure where your place is? Below mine, and while your current actions may place my life in your hands, they certainly do not elevate you above your true station.~ []
@1024561 = ~Alright, then... just join with me and we'll figure it out as we go along.~ []
@1024563 = ~I don't have time for this... if you really want to go, then go. I don't need a companion who babbles so much.~ []
@1024567 = ~It is in an altar, here, and we must bring it to Raelis Shai, mistress of the Sigil theater troupe. I assure you, she shall be more than pleased to see it. Come, let us find it before more unpleasantness occurs.~ []
@1024573 = ~Haer'Dalis, there is always room for one such as you within my company.~ []
@1024576 = ~I doubt he will say a word. He's as soft as Nalia at times, but he does not lower himself to dealing with his lessers. Do rescue him, will you? It is your duty, I believe.~ []
@1024577 = ~In an altar, here, if I remember right. Once this gem was mine, you see, and it must be mine once more that I might deliver it to Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe for she has need of it. Come, let us search this place and then make this long-delayed delivery.~ []
@1024582 = ~Oh, 'tis like a nightmare! Yet more hooligans tracking their filth through the halls! We shall have to vacation for a tenday while the whole building is deloused.~ [DELCIA02]
@1024583 = ~You are angry, my friend. This I understand implicitly. Injustice and indifference have always been the banes of our society. I often suspect that these sins pose more of a danger to us than any dragon ever could.~ [MAZZY67]
@1024591 = ~When Kalos heard Dana was gone, he and his friends took up what arms they could. They stormed the Baron's manor unthinking, like men gone berserk.~ []
@1024595 = ~If you could only find it and bring it to my quarters at the playhouse beneath the Five Flagons Inn, I promise you Miss Shai would be most grateful.~ []
@1024601 = ~It bears repeating my dear. She would slum as you do, offering charity to those beneath her, and her reward was a pestilence that took her life.~ []
@1024605 = ~Milady, we should save such discussion for another TIME. Let's move on. NOW.~ []
@1024610 = ~What am I saying? You will NEVER need to worry about being in a position such as I hold. Simply don't have the blood for it.~ []
@1024612 = ~Nalia, I think we should let your aunt get to safety while we MOVE ON. Now. Please.~ []
@1024621 = ~I would like that, Haer'Dalis.~ []
@1024624 = ~Return to your playhouse, Haer'Dalis. I shall look for this jewel you speak of and bring it to you there.~ []
@1024631 = ~Raelis Shai, Mistress of the Sigil theater troupe, beneath the Five Flagons Inn, would be more than pleased to have it in her possession. Come, let us retrieve it and make haste unto the playhouse.~ []
@1024632 = ~I believe the gem to be in an altar, here... if you could retrieve it and return it to me at the playhouse, Mistress Shai would be most pleased. It would be advisable that you hurry, too, as Mekrath will no doubt be returning shortly. Now I must go.~ []
@1024634 = ~Before my capture at Mekrath's hands, I carried with me a certain gem. I believe it to be in an altar, here... deliver it to me at the playhouse below the Five Flagons and Miss Shai will be more than grateful.~ []
@1024643 = ~Hmm? Oh! Yes, we should... really get moving. You will be safe back the way we came, Aunty, but I cannot go with you yet.~ []
@1024645 = ~You needn't whisper, dear, but do try to refrain from talking behind my back with the help, will you? It does not do them good to see their betters maligned.~ []
@1024648 = ~Rather an amusing bit of restraint on your part, and I appreciate that. She's decent enough, but very set in her ways and hard to deal with. Come, we must rescue my father.~ [NALIA72]
@1024649 = ~What? And who be you then? Come 'round the back way did ye? I suppose ye must have. Nothin' but trolls and snakes the front way. What are ye doin' here then?~ []
@1024650 = ~Fear not, I have come to rescue you.~ []
@1024654 = ~You? Rescue me? I ain't nobody, even the trolls know that, so they left me to tend the animals cuz I ain't no threat. Did Miss Nalia send you?~ []
@1024656 = ~Now why would you want to go and do something like that? Sure don't sound like you care much for the likes of me. It were Miss Nalia what sent you, wasn't it?~ []
@1024658 = ~Will you now? And why do you care about this place? Could only be two reasons. Either you heard this place ain't as poor as you say, or... or Miss Nalia sent you.~ []
@1024664 = ~Nalia did send me, and I just meant that I would stop the trolls from taking over.~ []
@1024670 = ~It's not like that at all. I'm just more interested in the combat and reward.~ []
@1024672 = ~Nothin' personal, but thrillseekers like you get us little guys hurt. I guess you're better than nothing, and probably better than Nalia. She means well, I suppose, but she's still a noble.~ []
@1024686 = ~Maybe thirty. There was a big troll that seemed to be in charge. I've kept out of sight, but I also heard him bossing something called a "yuan-ti". I don't know how many of those there are.~ []
@1024687 = ~Probably took him down to the dungeon. Lord de'Arnise had his dungeon boarded up, but I think them trolls sniffed it out. Don't know why they didn't just kill everyone.~ []
@1024701 = ~I'll just be staying right here, thanks all the same. They ain't bothered to come get me yet, and if you go out there making trouble, I think this is the safest place for me.~ []
@1024703 = ~Of course not, just having a little fun with you.~ []
@1024706 = ~You... you 're no better than the monsters out there. Have it your way, but make no mistake you will pay for this in the long run, I just knows it!~ []
@1024707 = ~This place isn't open to your kind anymore. This estate and all its possessions are now in the care of Family Roenall. Move along, rabble.~ []
@1024708 = ~He is well. He told me their strengths, and that a Lord de'Arnise was still alive.~ []
@1024709 = ~Storm Ring

This ring is worn by followers of the Storm Lord Talos, whose disciples await their god's wrath and welcome it eagerly. The ability to wreak havoc and ruin are the principal ideals that Talos desires in his subjects.~ []

Level: 6 
Sphere: Guardian/ Creation 
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When cast, Blade Barrier creates a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades which whirl and flash around the caster, forming an impenetrable barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the blade barrier suffers 8D8 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs. spells.

Level: 7
Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 80 yards
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, he calls forth a mass of venomous, biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpetlike mass swarms over a large area spreading to all the creatures within 30 feet of the target. Those trapped by the insects suffer 2 points of damage each second, and a spell failure rate of 100%. For each round the victim remains inside the cloud he must make a save vs. spells at -2 or run away in fear for one round. The advantage of Creeping Doom over its fifth level counterpart Insect Plague is that it does twice as much damage in half the amount of time.~

Level: 7

Range: 0
Duration: Special

Uttering a Holy Word channels magic of tremendous power. The priest acts as a bridge between his god and the prime material plane, causing a small explosion centered on the priest and reaching out to a radius of 15 feet. The spell affects creatures of any evil alignment that are caught in the area of effect. The effects experienced differ according to the hit dice of the target, as follows:

Hit Dice
1 to 4: Death
4 to 7: Stunned for 1 turn
8 to 11: Slowed for 1 turn with 75% chance of spell failure
12 and up: Deafened for 1 turn with 50% chance of spell failure

There is no saving throw vs. this spell, and the effects are instantaneous. Holy Word may not be cast by priests of evil alignment.~ []

@1026021 = ~Neither of which is conclusive evidence. Lots of people have leather and a smell could be anything! You killed a man over this?~ []

@1026087 = ~What do you have that smells like guril berries?~ []
@1026088 = ~Let me see. Hmm... looks quite thick indeed. Very rare, but I have seen it before. This is elephant hide. Good for strong armor, but I rarely see it.~ []
@1026097 = ~Locally? Well, let me think. I know of three things with that smell. Guril berries are one, and the bark of the oak is similar. And solik berries, too.~ []
@1026098 = ~What would these things be used for locally?~ []

@1026168 = ~Yes, certainly... here is a gold piece for her.~ []
@1026170 = ~She's sick, is she? Perhaps you could bring me to her... I might be able to offer her some help.~ []
@1026171 = ~I'm sorry... I can afford to give you nothing.~ []

@1026203 = ~Hey... you! Give me your money NOW or you're going to regret it... comprehend, yes?~ []
@1026204 = ~Alright, alright... here you go...~ []

@1026302 = ~Eek! The commoner is speaking to me again! What should I do? Shoo... shoo, shoo!~ []
@1026303 = ~I am an escort to the Lord Feveron and the Lady Diana... you will maintain your manners with them or suffer the consequences. Now off with you, citizen, before you make trouble.~ []
@1026305 = ~Spell Trap (Abjuration) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

This powerful spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap -- making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, a wizard shields himself with spell trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd level spell). He gets three spell levels back -- he will regain one spell, up to 3rd level in power.
The spell trap protects against 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~
@1026307 = ~Sorry for bothering you.~ []
@1026311 = ~Why are you closed? Hiding something, are you?~ []
@1026315 = ~Spellstrike (Abjuration, Alteration) 
Level: 9
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel all of the magical protections that surround that creature. This includes: Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Invulnerability, and Spell Trap. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell. ~
@1026324 = ~Sandform (Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None~ []
@1026326 = ~Why... thank you, citizens, for saving me from those mongrels. To think I actually thought it was a good idea to keep them as strong deckhands. Ah, well... a reward for your trouble.~ []
@1026330 = ~Chain Contingency (Evocation) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The Caster
Saving Throw: None 

Chain contingency channels some of the magical energy of the mage and releases it only under certain circumstances. Basically, the mage chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of 8th level or lower may be used in the contingency. ~

@1026354 = ~Most excellent! I have defeated the loathsome Carbos! Come, my beloved Bubbles... let us go!~ []
@1026358 = ~Bubbles! But... but Bubbles!! But I love you, my chicken pot pie! Come back!~ []
@1026359 = ~Aha! That moron, Shank, is now dead! I am victorious! Come, my Bubbles... let us go and celebrate this blessed event!!~ []
@1026361 = ~Bubbles? But... but, Bubbles?! Honeymelon, where are you going?~ []
@1026362 = ~Shapechange (Alteration) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of one of a number of powerful creatures (mind flayer, iron golem, greater wolfwere, earth elemental, fire elemental, or giant troll). The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has almost all of its abilities. Thus, he can change into a mind flayer to stun his opponents, and then become an earth elemental to crush them. The wizard retains the same number of hit points while using these alternate forms. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred. Although the assumed form has the combat characteristics of the real creature, it may not have all of its immunities.~ []
@1026363 = ~So, you were the one who has been speaking ill of me? You gathered this... evidence? So there's others that will know too? Then it will not stop here.~ [TANNER06]
@1026366 = ~So... you are admitting to being the killer? Why did you do this?~ []
@1026374 = ~I see. You have gathered this... er, evidence? I suppose others will know of this as well then? Then it will not stop with your leaving.~ [TANNER07]
@1026375 = ~Not to disappoint you, but there are many, many people that own leather, you among them, I am sure. I make my living selling it, so I know how common it is.~ []
@1026381 = ~See that you don't. Goodbye.~ []
@1026386 = ~What is your point? It is a common smell, especially on new armor. Many sets are sold each day. I am not responsible for how they are used, any more than a blacksmith would be.~ []
@1026390 = ~Well, that is certainly damning evidence. I mean, who would have new smelling leather armor. Perhaps only half of all the people in Athkatla.~ []
@1026392 = ~You should have run away, little fool! You could not understand! My work must go on!~ []
@1026403 = ~(cough!)  Oh... bless you, my <LADYLORD>, bless you! (cough!)  I did not know how much longer I would survive buried in there as I was!~ []
@1026405 = ~I... I was buried by the men who kidnapped me! (cough!)  They held me for ransom from my family, and after my family had paid they knocked me out.~ []
@1026406 = ~I... I remember being carried here, and thrown into that grave next to another body! And then they buried me alive! (cough!)~ []
@1026407 = ~I am sure... I am sure I would have died if you had not arrived so soon! (shudder!)  What a horrid death these evil men had in store for me! Ohhh...~ []
@1026412 = ~I woke up with this in my hand... I think I must have torn it off his shirt when he threw me in the grave. Here... perhaps it will help you find him.~ []
@1026415 = ~Thank you... I shall do my best to locate these man.~ []
@1026416 = ~Oh, no, I couldn't! These men are still out there... and they will surely come after me and my family if they knew I said anything!~ []
@1026418 = ~Please... you must... you must stop them! I beg of you!~ []
@1026420 = ~Sorry... I have no time to help you. You will have to go to the garrison.~ []
@1026421 = ~I... I thank you for saving my life. But I am still in danger! <cough!>  You... look capable with your weapons... please find these men and stop them!~ []
@1026422 = ~Only that... there was someone who spoke to this man. Perhaps the gravekeeper. You should talk to him, at least... he must have seen something!~ []
@1026423 = ~Thank you... I shall do my best to locate these men and bring them to justice.~ []
@1026424 = ~On second thought, I think there is little I can do. You have your life, now... go to the garrison or not, it is your choice.~ []
@1026426 = ~Oooh, no, I cannot go to the garrison... but thank you for saving me. I must return to my family. I pray these men don't take another victim. Farewell!~ []
@1026428 = ~I am not sure, Viconia... I have a couple of ideas of where to start looking, though, and I must make the effort.~ []

@1026431 = ~Rampah dance! Rampah no be disturbed. You get going. Talk business when you have important!~ []

@1026435 = ~Over time, we formed an awkward friendship. He did not ask why I wore my hood, and I slowly began to trust him. He wondered, though... that was obvious.~ []
@1026439 = ~I woke up to searing pain. While unconscious, they had abused and tortured me... then tried to bury their sins.~ []
@1026463 = ~Then I will show you when we have the time. I will take you through the deepest lands, and you will see the beauty that I know is there.~ []
@1026464 = ~That is, if you have not tired of my company yet.~ []
@1026467 = ~I see what is there. Beauty is irrelevant.~ []
@1026472 = ~W... well. I would... I would miss your company too, <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1026474 = ~Ho there, I have worked long and lonely hours and it is good to see a friendly face! Care to see some of my trinkets and far-flung wares?~ []
@1026475 = ~Something... for the lady, perhaps? Oh, yes, I see a glint in the eye. There is romance afoot, and it needs the dancing partner of the adornments of affection!~ []
@1026477 = ~Nonsense! Oh, but perhaps I have overstepped my bounds with my observant eyes. I apologize most profusely.~ []
@1026487 = ~Load times will go MUCH faster if you have done a full install.~ []

@1026557 = ~There! Stupid git didn't deserve more than a sweater and a kick in the rump, anyway! Hmph!! Now... I wonder where my Calimshite darling went off to... always time for one last quickie...~ []
@1026559 = ~You bastard! Now I'll have to pay to have you reburied! I should have you chopped into mulch and fed to a dog!! Gah! Now... where is that idiot priest...~ []
@1026562 = ~He was a good man, he was. (sniff!)  Just stubborn... refused to give up his coin pouch to a thief. Stubborn fool.~ []
@1026574 = ~What? All right then, what is it you want? What are you trying to pull here?~ []
@1026577 = ~What? What did that little weasel tell you? I knew I shouldn't trust him. I had no choice. Them or me.~ []
@1026581 = ~Hold, there... you have an aura of suspicion about you. I warn you that I am Kamir, Paladin of Helm... I will brook no trespass on this, my darkest of days.~ []
@1026589 = ~I am no more unique than most who come here. My son lies in yon wee grave. I... I failed my oath to protect the lad, and he has been taken from me.~ []

@1026595 = ~Tirdir? But he's... It was that little weasel Sethle, wasn't it? He told you. I knew I shouldn't trust him! I had no choice though! Them or me!~ []
@1026596 = ~Please... leave us alone. There is nothing more that can be done for our poor Wellyn.~ []
@1026598 = ~Why would someone do this? (sob!)  What could possess someone to kill a little boy? And a halfling, too... he never hurt anyone!~ []
@1026604 = ~Calm yourself, my darling. There is... nothing more that can be done for him.~ []
@1026608 = ~But why?! (sob!)  I just... don't... understand... (sob!)~ []
@1026611 = ~You, there... leave us alone. Can't you see that my wife is upset? Just... just leave us be.~ []
@1026616 = ~Yes... Arvoreen's blessing.~ []
@1026617 = ~This is... a terrible tragedy. My heart goes out to both of you. Life beyond our simple burrows is never simple or easy. Arvoreen's blessing upon your son.~ []
@1026620 = ~(sniff!)  Do you... do you truly think so?~ []
@1026621 = ~Thank you, sir. That is... that is very kind of you to say.~ []
@1026625 = ~I... I couldn't! I can't... I can't stand the blood!~ []
@1026630 = ~And I have. I mean... I mean that I did. I love... loved the lad dearly. Stefan I named him. Strong, honest boy.~ []
@1026632 = ~Who's there? What do you vermin wish now? The guard will hear of this outrage! Who... You are not my captors. Who are you? I demand to be freed!~ []
@1026636 = ~Well, I thank you then. I have been in this place too long. No doubt my ransom was on the way, but I begin to doubt they would have released me.~ []
@1026640 = ~Tell me about this oath, then... surely it cannot be that bad.~ []
@1026642 = ~I tire of this maudlin whining... I'll leave you to it.~ []
@1026643 = ~But I am. I failed my vow. And I know no way in which I can atone for my failure. If... if there was only some way... I would embrace it, gladly.~ []
@1026648 = ~I and my descendants are in your debt. Farewell.~ []
@1026666 = ~An... an orphan, you say? Perhaps... perhaps that would be a way... to atone for my failure. Thank you, my <LADYLORD>... I shall go and talk to them at once.~ []
@1026668 = ~It is no matter. I do not expect you to. But please... leave me to my grief a little longer. I... I am not ready to leave my son just yet.~ []
@1026679 = ~I am Dawnlord Arenthis of the Lathander church... excuse my young charge. Risa doesn't talk much since the recent death of her parents.~ []
@1026683 = ~Indeed it is. And there is very little that can be done for her, as well... other than to put her into an orphanage, I suppose. She is so shy and sad, though, I am sure it will do her no good. Tsk.~ []
@1026684 = ~If only there were someone who would care for her. Hmm. You strike me as a good person... perhaps you would be willing to care for a child in need? What would you say to that?~ []
@1026691 = ~My life is not for a child... but there is a paladin not far from here who I think might be a suitable guardian. His own son has just died... and I think he might be amenable.~ []
@1026694 = ~I would not ask you to care for her, surely... but might you know of someone who would make a suitable guardian?~ []
@1026695 = ~You... you are the one I am to meet? I know of no one else that would approach me. Show me the note if you are who you appear to be.~ []
@1026696 = ~Some compassion would not be out of order for one so young and innocent, I would think. Please... leave us alone, then, if you cannot find it in your heart.~ []
@1026704 = ~Actually, there is a paladin not far from here who I think might be a suitable guardian. His own son has just died... and I think he might be amenable.~ []
@1026708 = ~I wish this over with quick, so whatever it is, it will have to do.~ []
@1026709 = ~A paladin? A true paladin? Perhaps... perhaps that would be an excellent idea. If he is willing, that is.~ []
@1026710 = ~Please, my <LADYLORD>... it would mean so much if you could find this paladin and ask him about this. Risa needs a proper guardian much more than an orphanage. I beg it of you!~ []
@1026716 = ~Forget it... I have better things to do.~ []
@1026717 = ~Our deal is done. May you rot for what you have done.~ []
@1026718 = ~Actually, there is a paladin not far from here who I think might be a suitable guardian. His own son has just died... and I think he might be amenable.~ []
@1026723 = ~I cannot, my <LADYLORD>. I must stay and care for Risa. If you could seek out this paladin, I would be most grateful... and Lathander would smile on you.~ []
@1026724 = ~(sniff!) ... go 'way!~ []
@1026726 = ~Greetings again, my <LADYLORD>. Ach... it still pains me so that Risa, here, has no choice but to go to an orphanage. It would do her little good, I think.~ []
@1026727 = ~Hail once again, my <LADYLORD>. I... please. I ask that you leave me to grieve for my son in peace.~ []
@1026729 = ~Tell me about this oath, then... surely it cannot be that bad.~ []
@1026730 = ~All right... I shall leave you be.~ []
@1026733 = ~The... the locket is lovely, by the way. Thank you.~ []
@1026736 = ~Greetings... greetings to you both. I... I understand that the girl is in need of a guardian?~ []
@1026737 = ~You are a paladin, are you?  I am pleased to meet you.  This is--~ []
@1026739 = ~... yes. Yes, I am most pleased to agree. This is Risa.~ []
@1026747 = ~Oh... you must be very sad...~ []
@1026748 = ~Yes, I am. I miss him very much. I think he would approve, however, of me taking care of you. That is... if you are willing.~ []
@1026749 = ~O-okay... where do you live?~ []
@1026750 = ~Come... I shall show you the church. Thank you, cleric... and thank you, too, my <LADYLORD>. I am... most appreciative.~ []
@1026751 = ~I am most pleased at this wonderful turn of events. Lathander's greatest blessing upon you, my <LADYLORD>, for the part you have played in this. Sometimes... sometimes Faerun can be a kind place...~ []

Level: 5
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch

Saving Throw: None 

When cast, this spell confers upon the target a resistance to all magic, equal to 2% per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level. This resistance is set, so if the target already has more magic resistance than the spell would confer, their resistance will actually be lowered to the set value.~ []

@1027024 = ~You don't? (sob!)  Oh... could you get him? Could you get my stuffed bear, pleeeaaasse?~ []
@1027029 = ~... Th-thank you, <SIRMAAM>...~ []
@1027030 = ~... Mama? Papa? Is that you? Do you have my Littleman?~ []
@1027035 = ~(sob!)  Mama? Is that you? (sob!)  You're not my mama! But... but you have my bear! You have my Littleman!!~ []
@1027036 = ~Oh, please... I cannot sleep without my Littleman! Can I have him... can I have him, please?~ []
@1027037 = ~This stuffed bear? Er, certainly... here you go...~ []
@1027039 = ~What?! You won't give me my bear?! You... you are so MEAN!!~ []
@1027040 = ~Ahhhh... fleshling! This is OUR land in the evening... this is no place for such as YOU!!~ []
@1027043 = ~Aaah! Oh... me pardons... I thought ye were that bloody ghost again...!~ []
@1027048 = ~Oh, aye... unfortunately. A, uh... ghost is sometimes hauntin' me. Terrible, frightenin' thing, that is.~ []
@1027053 = ~Well... yes it is. How did you know that?~ []
@1027056 = ~This ghost you mentioned... it wouldn't be a little halfling boy by the name of Wellyn, would it?~ []
@1027060 = ~I am a, er... merchant of fine goods, me <LADYLORD>. Pleased t' meet ye. Now, if ye'll excuse me... ye are in my room...~ []
@1027065 = ~Oh... er, I don't know. Can't say for sure. Excuse me, but this does be me private room... could ye please leave?~ []
@1027066 = ~This ghost wouldn't be haunting you because it is a little boy you murdered and robbed, would it, hm? Hand over his bear... now.~ []
@1027069 = ~Alright, alright... I'm going.~ []
@1027070 = ~You're... you're here to retrieve his... bear? I, uh... I think I have it around here, somewhere. Yes... let me take a look... ah, yes. Here it is.~ []
@1027071 = ~Give... give that to the little bloody bastard and tell him to stay away from me!~ []
@1027073 = ~I'll spare your life... but don't let me catch you around here again!~ []
@1027075 = ~What?! How... how did you know about that?! Well... you'll not take ME alive!!~ []
@1027082 = ~Alright, alright... I'm going, I'm going... just let me collect me things, here...~ []
@1027083 = ~Oh, it is, it is... I'll just collect me things and I'll be out o' yer hair...~ []
@1027088 = ~Oh... it's you again... what is it ye want, now?~ []
@1027095 = ~Our... our little boy is at peace, now. He appeared to us to say good-bye, and told us that you had rescued his bear. I... I thank you, my <LADYLORD>, you are very kind.~ []
@1027096 = ~Yes, thank you so much. (sniff!)  It is... such a relief. Come, my husband... let us go home.~ []
@1027100 = ~Oh... I am so happy that you have come back!~ []
@1027101 = ~Oy, now! What... what are you doin' sneakin' up on a fella in the middle o' the bleedin' night, aye?~ []
@1027104 = ~You look like you're digging up that grave... what are you, some kind of graverobber?~ []
@1027105 = ~Sorry... didn't mean to bother you.~ []
@1027110 = ~Listen, here... you either cough up some money or I'll report you to the garrison.~ []
@1027113 = ~I'm just diggin' up a bit o' buried treasure... hey, now. Ye gives me the willies, ye does. Ye're in league with the bleedin' garrison, ye are!!~ []
@1027114 = ~No, I'm not... but I'll not allow you to commit this sacrilege!~ []
@1027120 = ~Well... all right. But make a move on, then, or ye'll be regrettin' it mighty soon.~ []
@1027121 = ~Ho, citizen! On orders of the Council, I accuse you of crimes against Amn.~ []
@1027133 = ~You're on the wrong side of the river here, friend. This is Shadow Thief territory and we can't have you committing monstrous crimes without our permission.~ []
@1027146 = ~There may be such a woman... it could be that the answer to your question is playing itself out right now.~ []
@1027147 = ~Jaheira, I don't care that... what? Glad? I thought you wanted this?~ []
@1027170 = ~I am not in a mood to converse with madmen of the sewers. Back to your slime pit, old fool!~ []
@1027185 = ~My one true companion, topsider.~ []
@1027201 = ~No... I enjoy the excitement of this life. Is that so hard to understand?~ []
@1027210 = ~Well, think about it, then. But do so silently... and let us continue our travels.~ []
@1027215 = ~'Passing by?' Athkatla? I see. Well, thank you for... thank you for following me, even if you are only 'passing by.'~ []
@1027220 = ~Then you do not know me well, <CHARNAME>. I am unlike you all. In some ways... if not all.~ []
@1027228 = ~You remove the ring from the finger and it tingles in your palm. There is obviously something special about the ring.~ []
@1027231 = ~Certainly. If you wish to discuss nothing and have no conversation of any type... if you wish to remain an ignorant dalhar, I am only happy to oblige.~ []
@1027232 = ~Notice the lack of Spectral Harpists? They were here at one time, and they would not leave their post unless it was no longer to be guarded.~ []
@1027237 = ~True... but if that were not the case, you would consider such a thing natural, yes? I have seen the custom borne out and cannot grasp the notion properly.~ []
@1027240 = ~Those we kill in self-defense may look like Harper allies, even if they are not. We have no choice, and I will not feel guilty over this tangled web any more.~ []
@1027250 = ~Then we will go together. Rejoin and... and walk with me.~ []
@1027263 = ~You are a cold and vicious woman, Viconia.~ []
@1027266 = ~That sounds like an excuse.~ []
@1027279 = ~You not know the glory of Crragtail! You stupid <RACE> of above, where sun causes rot and dryout! Down here all is moist and soft, and good throne!~ []
@1027297 = ~Peeeyewww... rrrr...~ []
@1027300 = ~I do not tolerate threats from creatures that live in filth!~ []
@1027309 = ~Staff? You want Stick of Many Foods?! You not get! You come to steal greatest treasure of Crragtail empire! Better than Throne of Comfy, or Pipe That Smell Not Quite So Much!~ []
@1027311 = ~RRaagh! Rrget yourr traitorrrr!!!!~ []
@1027318 = ~I do not wish to diminish the glory of your rule, but how does 2,000 gold sound?~ []
@1027320 = ~Grrrr... rrwha?~ []
@1027324 = ~Ehh... how much you say? What wa' dat?~ []
@1027325 = ~2,000 gold for the glory of your realm.~ []
@1027326 = ~I was taunting you. I offer nothing! You live in a fool's realm!~ []
@1027327 = ~Yeah, glory, whateverrrr. Stick yours. Have funs above.~ []
@1027328 = ~Reaagh... wha?!!~ []
@1027331 = ~Wha... RRRAAAGHHH!!~ []
@1027332 = ~Yes, I intend to have power for myself.~ []
@1027335 = ~You wish to have power, do you? I... I think...~ []
@1027336 = ~... I think it is disgusting that a lowly male would desire to rise so far past his place. You are nothing like Shar or Lolth!~ []
@1027337 = ~Ah, I see. As I thought, you are yet the reticent coward. You remind me of the lowly drow males, crawling along the ground on your belly with eyes downcast.~ []
@1027338 = ~The undersea of Laratrak, for example, defies words. To sail across takes two days luent to linoin... east to west... three days trezen to werneth... north to south.~ []
@1027345 = ~Do not be a wael... a fool. I enjoyed it well enough; I killed for sport and necessity, but I took no pleasure in sacrifice solely to satiate her endless desire.~ []
@1027347 = ~They took me to the orlenggin... the sacrificial altar... where a surfacer screamed in agony, and for the pleasure of Lolth I was given a spider dagger to end his life.~ []
@1027348 = ~This human was but a kul'gobuss to me, but it felt wrong. He was bare and chained... helpless. His tears ran freely as he begged for mercy in his unfamiliar tongue.~ []
@1027350 = ~There were... many sacrifices, were there?~ []
@1027354 = ~It is the drow way. But that is... behind me, now. Let us continue our travels, <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1027355 = ~My heart is filled with bile at these memories, at any rate. Yes... yes, do let us move on.~ []
@1027356 = ~He... he was no mere male! Is it so difficult for you to believe that I might have cared for another, once?!~ []
@1027357 = ~Yes. Yes, he saved me. I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, I do not wish to continue discussing Valas. Excuse me.~ []
@1027361 = ~Our... our relationship was unusual, yes...~ []
@1027362 = ~... I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I do not wish to discuss Valas any further. Excuse me.~ []
@1027363 = ~There are normally no...'brothers', although some males are favored more than others. Most simply exist to serve Queen and House, but this is... not always the case.~ []
@1027366 = ~You mentioned your brother, before... he was a special case?~ []
@1027380 = ~So I will fear no more. I... I value your company, <CHARNAME>. After all we have been through, I must know: do you value my company as well?~ []
@1027383 = ~... of the party? So, business alone has kept you with me. Very well... Best I know now, before... Well, that is quite enough of that. Let's go, shall we?~ []
@1027386 = ~I won't delay us any longer for now. We will speak again on this, in better spirits, I hope.~ []
@1027387 = ~Ah, the dawning of our day, though it is very rarely that we seem to match our sleep cycle to the day or night.~ [JAHEIRB1]
@1027392 = ~Sunrises are but one of, oh, at least two things worth waking to I could think of.~ []
@1027395 = ~Perhaps, though I intend no malice. I would laugh at you as I laugh at myself, and... hopefully I will come to know you that well.~ []
@1027400 = ~No need to. No sunrise could compare with your beauty in the moonlight.~ []
@1027405 = ~Stop.~ [JAHEIRB2]
@1027406 = ~Do you see him? Ready yourself.~ [JAHEIRBX]
@1027410 = ~As you were 'forced' to deal with the Harpers that died in Athkatla?~ []
@1027412 = ~The garish Hold, his political agenda; he was merely using the weight of the Harper name to promote himself. Tell me: what did he offer you?~ []
@1027415 = ~Ah, but the events are not known. What is accepted is that you have killed your brethren and taken up with a known murderer. There is no evidence existing to the contrary.~ []
@1027417 = ~One grows weary. We would have done good works, Jaheira, just from a more profitable perspective.~ []
@1027419 = ~Innocent?! Is that what you call <CHARNAME>? But <PRO_HESHE> is a child of Bhaal! Whether his nature is good or bad it will certainly be disruptive!~ []
@1027423 = ~Ah, your wit is still the most dangerous trait about you, Jaheira. I told you to cultivate it. Little did I know I would be on the receiving end one day.~ []
@1027430 = ~Heh, you and your jokes make me smile far too often, even when I do not want to. People will think I am getting soft.~ []
@1027433 = ~Haha! Shush you! I'm supposed to be feeling bad about this whole thing. Oh, let's just get moving.~ []
@1027442 = ~Nothing, though morale is going to slip if you keep glaring at people.~ []
@1027451 = ~That's what I said but I meant... I'm sorry, I shouldn't need to play these games. I'm just so mad and I don't know how to get it out.~ []
@1027455 = ~He put you in the position of opposing a mentor. It couldn't help but trouble you.~ []
@1027460 = ~I need you to say... what? I don't know either. I'm sorry, this is not fair to you at all.~ []
@1027463 = ~My brother, Valas, was an exception to the standard drow male. He was my childhood friend... and perhaps my only friend, after all is said.~ []
@1027465 = ~He... watched over me and protected me, and I ensured that the worst of the abuses that befell males did not strike him.~ []
@1027466 = ~In the end... he saved my life. He... prevented my sacrifice and killed our mother, giving me the opportunity to flee.~ []
@1027470 = ~He... no longer exists. <CHARNAME>... I am cold and tired and no longer in the mood to speak. Excuse me.~ []
@1027474 = ~(sigh)  Let us... just walk for a while in silence, <CHARNAME>. I am no longer in the mood to talk.~ []
@1027493 = ~So... where was I? Oh, yes. Your part in this. I would like you to go to Mae'Var and join his guild.~ []
@1027495 = ~Sometimes your self-righteous sense of judgement makes me ill to my stomach, <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1027496 = ~Yes... so am I. But... that does not mean she will never do so. (sigh)  Come, <CHARNAME>... the road beckons.~ []
@1027499 = ~Alright, fine, I'll stay for a moment. By the gods, Viconia... you're shaking! What is the matter?~ []
@1027501 = ~Then begone, rath'arg... and leave me alone to my misery.~ []
@1027504 = ~I... I dream of Valas, sometimes, and I try to speak to him in my dreams. But he is only a monster, now, and I scream when his horrid spider legs caress me...~ []
@1027505 = ~I think... what can Lolth do to me if she has done this to Valas? What worse torments await me when she finally decides to come?!~ []
@1027506 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am frightened to my very core! Do not leave me alone! Stay with me this night. I... I need to feel your flesh next to mine, to embrace your strength...~ []
@1027507 = ~It will mean... it will mean nothing. Lolth's reach is far... and I fear there is no escaping it...~ []
@1027513 = ~I do not wish to be cheerful; I wish to be miserable, hating everything that has led to what we are.~ []
@1027517 = ~All right... I will stay with you, if that is what you wish.~ []
@1027525 = ~Do not deny me this, <CHARNAME>... I offer to you all the pleasures that a drow woman may bestow if you but hold me this night.~ []
@1027526 = ~I... do not doubt your ability, Viconia. And you are beautiful. But not like this, not in this manner...~ []
@1027527 = ~Very well, Viconia... I shall stay with you this night if that is what you wish.~ []
@1027529 = ~Viconia... not like this. Not because you are desperate... it isn't right.~ []
@1027530 = ~I do. Come to my arms out of view of prying eyes... place your hand against my darkly trembling heart and I will show you the boundaries of passion as only I can...~ []
@1027531 = ~Do not deny me, <CHARNAME>... and do not deny yourself.~ []
@1027537 = ~My mother wished me to recant, to prostrate myself before the Spider Queen and beg forgiveness. She was desperate that I do so, in fact.~ []
@1027540 = ~What if they were the wrong ones? I have turned this over and over in my mind, and the dead have piled up and I have still gone forward.~ []
@1027544 = ~She abandoned me, left me completely without power. I had no brother, no power and House DeVir was, as far as I knew, falling.~ []
@1027546 = ~Come, my children! Fear the power of Talos! Join us in reverent worship to avoid the disasters that are sure to strike us down in the days to come!~ []
@1027547 = ~I thought Talos is an evil god... how is it that he is openly worshipped here?~ []
@1027548 = ~I have heard a bit of Talos... tell me more.~ []
@1027564 = ~I have heard that Lathander is a young and vain god... why would you grant him obeisance?~ []
@1027567 = ~Lathander may be prone to the vagaries of youth but he has other gifts. To serve the Morninglord is to strive for vitality and joy... what is wrong with that?~ []
@1027573 = ~Bah! What does the heart know. It makes you do foolish things for no cause. It makes you forget the dead before you should. It makes you fall in...~ []
@1027578 = ~It most certainly is, supplicant. Enter our most sacred temple, and bask in the glory of the God of Dawns... experience His benevolence for yourself.~ []
@1027579 = ~It... makes you do things that wreak havoc on your mind. I'm a sorry, <CHARNAME>, you should not have to hear this. You have been good and true.~ []
@1027581 = ~I should be happy, but I am not. Even with all we have done to make things right, I am still troubled.~ []
@1027601 = ~And arrogance will kill you. They thought they were right, and we think we are right. Is there so much of a difference?~ []
@1027603 = ~You needn't keep a distance between us. I am in less of a mood now.~ [JAHEIRB5]
@1027606 = ~Should I tailor my mood to yours? You have proven unresponsive in the past.~ []
@1027609 = ~You have questioned our relationship at every step, even as you pursued it.~ []
@1027616 = ~You have questioned our relationship at every step, even as you pursued it.~ []
@1027618 = ~You have questioned our relationship at every step, even as you pursued it.~ []
@1027619 = ~This is a place of the peaceful and divine... not for the likes of you. Begone from here!~ []
@1027620 = ~I do so worry what has become of the missing priests... there are so many who have disappeared it is a terrible concern!~ []
@1027621 = ~I do not trust these preachers... what is this Unseeing Eye? It sounds horrid... and they have all plucked out their own eyes!~ []
@1027624 = ~I pay homage to all our gods, but I serve only Arvoreen. One day I hope to be foremost among His holy swords.~ []
@1027633 = ~Sometimes I feel as if the gods are testing me, little one... but overall, yes, they watch over me most kindly.~ []
@1027635 = ~It just isn't fair... I donate coin to Lathander for prosperity and Helm for protection... and then the Talassans come and burn down my shop!~ []
@1027636 = ~A merchant must cover all his bases and be wary to offend no god... it is a most trying existence!~ []
@1027642 = ~I am trying. You have shown such caring so far. I have taken you for granted as someone that would always be here, even as I questioned our very friendship.~ []
@1027644 = ~I will not make such a mistake again. Of this I am sure.~ []
@1027649 = ~I have... had a realization. I have been walking with my eyes downcast for so long I had forgotten the beauty of the land. I... all we have seen; I had thought never to feel the warmth of nature again.~ [JAHEIRB6]
@1027656 = ~You make me appreciate such things. I never appreciated a simple forest before you.~ []
@1027657 = ~Do we not see nature in everything? Even in the deepest dungeons?~ []
@1027660 = ~Oh, some days I am sure that the gods are all frowning on us. Faerun is doomed! Doomed!~ []
@1027661 = ~There are beings of great power in the planes that are my home... but do you think that they really concern themselves so much with this one? It strikes me as a barren fancy, really.~ []
@1027666 = ~There's no rest fer the wicked, they says... so I plan on prayin' extra hard today, I does.~ []
@1027667 = ~Pardon me fer a teeny bit o' blasphemy... but have ye seen the Morninglord's lasses as o' late? Now I know what 'em priests says about rebirth, I does!~ []
@1027676 = ~All these preachers about for this no-eyed god are a little creepy... I wonder what sins they absolve?~ []
@1027680 = ~By Lathander's grace the entire city has prospered... it is only right that we lay down in devotion to Him.~ []
@1027682 = ~The city is in dire straits with so many of the clergy disappearing... only to turn up as converts of this strange cult. It isn't right!~ []
@1027685 = ~By Lathander's grace... how can you bring one of those dark, evil things here into this part of the city?!~ []
@1027686 = ~I'll walk where I like, rivvil... and you can take your petty religious slurs and throw them in the river, for all I care!~ []
@1027688 = ~Why... that is the most darling little pet you have there, sir.~ []
@1027689 = ~Boo is no pet... he is a fine companion for Minsc. But he seems to like you anyway.~ []
@1027693 = ~And I would stay by the brooks of home if I wished only my reflection. I would like to see some of myself in your face, but not so much that I lose what is you.~ []
@1027696 = ~I must admit that Lathander seems to have the right idea... those gaudy, golden interiors are fit for a true King, if you ask me.~ []
@1027699 = ~Ah, if it isn't Lord Valygar. I am sorry, my lord... we still haven't built a temple to Mystra for your family, yet.~ []
@1027700 = ~Oh, stop it. I'm being serious here.~ []
@1027701 = ~You know very well, my lord, that I am no sorcerer... and nearly all of my family is well beyond the reach of your petty barbs!~ []
@1027704 = ~I do not know what you mean... I have no plans to leave my gnomish lord Baervan Wildwanderer... I owe Him too much, sir.~ []
@1027706 = ~She seems to be well enough remembered, here... but I thought her worship was no more.~ []
@1027709 = ~Indeed! In her time, Waukeen was known and welcomed fondly by all in the great City of Coin! The Promenade was built to honor her and trade prospered throughout!~ []
@1027710 = ~It is sad she disappeared from our lives... many of us still honor her. I am confident that one day she will return and claim all the wealth that is rightfully hers.~ []
@1027713 = ~Perhaps this changes nothing, perhaps everything. I don't care anymore. My heart cannot have nature within and be ashamed as well.~ []
@1027721 = ~We have to be nearing our goal. It has been so long a journey and we've been through so much. I hope this does not end up all being for naught.~ [JAHEIRB7]
@1027723 = ~I could not have come this far without you helping me, Jaheira.~ []
@1027728 = ~There can be no mercy for this creature. What he has done is unforgivable.~ []
@1027751 = ~Who knows, indeed. Yesterday saw friends die; saw blood spilled. Tomorrow...~ []
@1027756 = ~I see. Then stay up and talk with me for a while. I doubt I shall sleep.~ []
@1027759 = ~Perhaps we should take some time to talk.~ []
@1027769 = ~Er... yes... yes, I am. Why do you ask?~ []
@1027772 = ~Ack! I... are you sure? I mean... I have no memory...~ []
@1027774 = ~I... I see. What is it exactly that you want?~ []
@1027779 = ~Heh heh... oh, nothing, Talon Nirkhas. A simple mistake, perhaps, on my part. Please do excuse me. (You are in SUCH trouble, girl!)~ []
@1027780 = ~I see. Talos' blessing on you, then, and... er... good day.~ []
@1027781 = ~(ahem)  It is... not against my vows to drink the cups or sample the flesh of a willing woman. We Talassans favor pleasure in the face of the destruction of the Stormlord.~ []
@1027782 = ~Whew! I am certainly glad that situation was not what it seemed! There are many... ah... celebrations I have but hazy memories of!~ []
@1027783 = ~What are... what are you looking at? Nothing to see, here.~ []
@1027790 = ~The child is mine... like she was the cleric's? Or the gods know only how many other men's?~ []
@1027792 = ~She is? Er... how much do I owe you?~ []
@1027793 = ~Oh, er... perhaps I was mistaken. You look very similar to another I had... spent time with. Excuse me, my lord.~ []
@1027800 = ~I'll give you the money... for the little girl's sake if nothing else.~ []
@1027802 = ~I am afraid you're barking up the wrong tree... I do not have that to give you.~ []
@1027806 = ~Thank you, my lord. My name, by the way, is Miranda... and this is your, um, daughter, Lanie. We appreciate your dedication to duty and will see you anon, perhaps.~ []
@1027810 = ~Not many would, I suppose. She is a goddess of the halflings... representing our ideals of friendship and trust.~ []
@1027812 = ~As you might understand, it is important for us halflings to fit in wherever we can. A home is a home... we may as well strive to make it a pleasant home.~ []
@1027821 = ~Bah! It is the end come upon us! Many of our priests have disappeared... but some have returned to preach for this devil god! Talos will take revenge!!~ []
@1027833 = ~It is a good thing for Cyrando... he has such a way with words. He is a good friend... and I am a poor excuse for a bard. (sigh)~ []
@1027835 = ~The foolishness of this Garrick fellow... does he think the Lady Irlana does not see through his ruse?~ []
@1027836 = ~I am Sir Cadril, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. Pleased to make your acquaintance, my <LADYLORD>.~ []
@1027840 = ~If I e'er found a man who could speak as Garrick does, but with fluency and passion... then that man would have my heart, methinks.~ []
@1027841 = ~Greetings to you, my <LADYLORD>. I be Lady Irlana, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. At your service.~ []
@1027843 = ~This foolish boy, Garrick, can barely take instruction... sometimes I think he barely has a thought in his head.~ []
@1027844 = ~My heart goes out to the Lady Irlana... but this is as close a simple gnome such as I can ever hope to come to a noble beauty like her.~ []
@1027847 = ~Now, that's not necessarily true, my friend. My cousin Adecan married a fine human woman, he did. He was of the sort that was not fine to look on, as well... but she did appreciate his sense of humor.~ []
@1027850 = ~The lad could tell a joke to save his life, in fact. Once kept a trio of ogres laughing so heartily that they forgot to eat him. Too bad he didn't speak griffon, however... poor Adecan. I hear his last joke was a zinger, although the punchline got cut short.~ []

@1028601 = ~Well, Vittorio... I suppose that means your time has ran out, hasn't it?~ []
@1028604 = ~I have no intention of continuing the search... but nor will I allow you to touch this man, Dennis!~ []
@1028606 = ~I sold it to a fence by the name of Roger not too long ago, I do think. He... lives in the sewers below th' city, although I knows not exactly where. He... he should still have it...~ []
@1028607 = ~... My thanks, me <LADYLORD>... yer a kind one...~ []
@1028609 = ~So... you haven't found it, yet. Does this mean that you no longer intend to look?~ []
@1028612 = ~That's correct... but nor will I allow you to touch this man, Dennis! You'll release him at once!~ []
@1028615 = ~You have the gong? Excellent. Mother will be very pleased. As I promised, here is your reward... it should fetch an excellent price, unless you find another use for it.~ []
@1028616 = ~And you, Vittorio... you can go. But I warn you to stay out of my way... I don't even want to hear your name, you foul drunkard!~ []
@1028617 = ~... There is... there is just th' wee little matter of me bartab...?~ []
@1028618 = ~Grrr. You've got gall. But... I suppose I've got my gong. I'll pay half of your tab, fool. Now get out.~ []
@1028619 = ~Y-yes, yes, of course. And thank ye, me <LADYLORD>... I am most appreciative! You are so kind!~ []
@1028620 = ~Ye has the gong! Oh, thank ye, thank ye truly! Er... Dennis... the good <LADYLORD> has the gong...?~ []
@1028621 = ~Wh... what? That gong you have! That is my mother's gong! How did you get that?! Give it to me immediately!!~ []
@1028622 = ~It's yours? Very well, I have little enough use for it... here you go.~ []
@1028626 = ~My thanks! I have been looking for this ever since that drunken lout stole it! Here... take this magic item as a reward... it will fetch you a fair price if you wish to sell it.~ []
@1028629 = ~Hmmm... I suppose I could do that. Here... I have 500 gold pieces. That's a fair price for the gong... I'll not offer a copper more.~ []
@1028630 = ~Then I'll take it from your dead body! Men... attack!!~ []
@1028633 = ~Priestess of Ilmater~ []
@1028645 = ~Oh, you must be the messengers come to beg the service of Sir Sarles. It's a great honor to be refused by him, so don't feel bad when you leave empty-handed.~ []
@1028647 = ~Riatavin, to the far south, is rebelling against the Council... we be mercenaries hired to fight against Lady Aura and her kin.~ []
@1028658 = ~I am the mage of this mercenary troupe... I get paid well, and I'll thank you to leave me be.~ []
@1028659 = ~It matters not that Riatavin has petitioned to join Tethyr... their rebellion will not succeed. We shall crush them.~ []
@1028660 = ~The Cowled Wizards do not prevent mages from operating with the army... or with mercenaries. Especially mages of my skill.~ []
@1028666 = ~Helm has sent me forth. His everseeing eyes wish to gaze upon your work.~ []
@1028669 = ~Our fight against the town of Riatavin has been blessed by the gods... we shall surely prevail.~ []
@1028671 = ~I am the priest and healer of this mercenary group. I am their spirit and arm of faith... and I can battle as well as any of the men.~ []
@1028673 = ~Hmmn. I don't remember seeing you down here before. New customers, perhaps? Me name be Roger. Is there something that you... need?~ []
@1028675 = ~Yes, you will be gaining the favor of a powerful faith.~ []
@1028682 = ~Oh... odds and ends, mostly. I buy things from people who acquire things, and I don't ask where they acquire them from. And then I sell them to others. A redistribution of goods.~ []
@1028692 = ~No, what I need has not changed, and I have said so to your masters. The gold offered is sufficient, and I am just fine without the flattery.~ []
@1028702 = ~You are told? Have you not checked? Gathering the materials is not the job of a fine artist such as myself. Go speak with an ore merchant or somesuch.~ []
@1028705 = ~I recall the name of one that was referred to me on my last visit. Jerlia was her name, I believe. Speak with her. She has exotics occasionally. Try the Promenade.~ []
@1028707 = ~Alright, then. Remember... you haven't seen me, aye?~ []
@1028709 = ~What are you? Some kind of crime-fighter that scours the sewers? I be mindin' me own business, and that's all it is... business. If ye has a problem with it, then be on yer way.~ []
@1028714 = ~I'll be leaving, then... I've no interest in doing business with you.~ []
@1028715 = ~You have heard my conditions of service. Provide what I wish or I will not work for you. Check the Promenade if you seek an ore merchant.~ []
@1028716 = ~Well, I did not expect to see you back here so soon. Perhaps next time I should request to work only in blood-forged meteoric adamantite.~ []
@1028720 = ~I suppose I could part with a few coins for the deed. I tell you what... dispose of the sea troll beastie for me an' I'll be pleased to pay you 500 gold pieces, aye?~ []
@1028723 = ~I thank you on behalf of the followers of Talos.~ []
@1028730 = ~Our business is concluded. The piece will be delivered when it is done. I will dispatch a messenger to collect my fee and tell your church of my decision.~ [SARLES07]
@1028733 = ~How about rewarding me with something... say, a gong?~ []
@1028736 = ~Ahhh, I see. Well, I'll tell you what... do a little favor for me and I'll tell you who I sold that particular gong to, as well as where you can find 'em, aye?~ []
@1028744 = ~I sold it, through an envoy, to a troll shaman. Errr... Grae, I believe her name to be. Lives in a troll mound near Trademeet, ye can't miss it.~ []
@1028747 = ~I can't imagine she's the type to receive visitors... an' I believe the mound to be guarded by trolls a'plenty. But if ye want it, that's where it'd be.~ []
@1028753 = ~Heh heh. Looking for a reward, are we? Well, I can't say that it isn't deserved. Here... I have a few spare coins. 250 of them, all told. Thank ye kindly for the deed.~ []
@1028756 = ~Get rid o' the beastie that has been plaguing me about here... the sea troll t' be specific... an' I'll be pleased to tell you all I know. Aye?~ []
@1028766 = ~Ach, calm down, mate. You don't frighten me... I've dealt with harsher types then you. And besides... harming me won't find you out where the gong lies, now, will it?~ []
@1028773 = ~Actually, it's not that important to me... I'd much rather just kill you!~ []
@1028783 = ~(gulp)  er... how about I just start RUNNING FOR MY LIFE!!~ []
@1028788 = ~Well hello to you again, mate. I still notice that the beastie is runnin' around, yet... are you not plannin' on finishing our deal?~ []
@1028789 = ~No, no... I'll go back and finish the job.~ []
@1028791 = ~That's right... I've no interest in continuing this task.~ []
@1028795 = ~An excellent job, mate! Finally, my stores will be plenty safe from that troll's bug-eyed intrusions. Now, then... what was it, again, that you were lookin' for as a reward?~ []
@1028796 = ~He's in disguise. His kind doesn't look all that different, and as long as he's left alone, he's fine. Not a bad guy, once you get to know him.~ []
@1028800 = ~Err... 1,000 gold pieces.~ []
@1028807 = ~Did I promise that? Well, mate, here you go... an' a thanks to you for a deed well done. Anything ye need in the future, don't be hesitating to look me up.~ []
@1028811 = ~Heh... you must be thinkin' me mighty stupid, mate. If I remember right, I offered you 500 gold pieces. An' here it is... no need to be greedy, aye?~ []
@1028816 = ~Ahhh... always good to speak to you, mate. What is it, exactly, that you need?~ []
@1028828 = ~Ye be lookin' a mite out o' place, <GIRLBOY>. What brings ye above yer station? Found a gold mine?~ []
@1028832 = ~We seek a valuable gong that was sold to you by a fence in Amn... tell us where it is!~ []
@1028835 = ~Bonny good luck, then!~ []
@1028842 = ~Now the bastards fawn over me but horribly, all the while eyeing me purse.~ []
@1028843 = ~(hissss)  Wait! (gasp!)  I... I will tell you where the gong is! Mercy, humans!~ []
@1028848 = ~(hissss)  The gong... I sold it to Drush... an ogre mage. In the tower to the northeast, beside the house of the witch. He is gone but said he would return today.~ []
@1028857 = ~If this could ruin you, I should offer no less than 1,000 gold.~ []
@1028861 = ~(hissss)  You are... honorable? I... I must flee!~ []
@1028868 = ~Yes, we come in peace... why are you not attacking us?~ []
@1028874 = ~That depends... what are your intentions?~ []
@1028876 = ~Actually... I'm looking for a particular gong. Grae the troll shaman supposedly sold it to you.~ []
@1028879 = ~No reason... I'll be on my way.~ []
@1028881 = ~Blasted, vile, ignorant humanoids! Very well, then... feel my wrath!!~ []
@1028883 = ~As you wish, humanoids. You are welcome here at any time, so long as your intentions are peaceful... perhaps I will see you once again.~ []
@1028884 = ~I see. My kin have been here since the time of Umar... ever since then, the humans have come farther and farther out into these lands. Perhaps I should move on, soon. It is something to consider.~ []
@1028885 = ~Feel free to make yourselves at home... although I know that humanoids do not often find ogre tastes appealing. I would ask that you not steal anything, but beyond that you are welcome.~ []
@1028887 = ~I am sorry, but I cannot give this information out without compensation.~ []
@1028888 = ~A gong? Oh... that. Well, yes, I do have that... I saw it the last time I made a visit to the troll mound and thought it was of an adequate size to shovel cow dung. What do you need with it?~ []
@1028889 = ~It sounds like the end of me for a mere pittance. No, that is not enough.~ []
@1028891 = ~Do not concern yourself with our reasons... the fact is that we wish to have the gong.~ []
@1028894 = ~Very well, I will offer 1,000 gold to compensate you.~ []
@1028896 = ~Forget it! Give me the gong, now... or else!~ []
@1028899 = ~I happen to have one, here... let's trade.~ []
@1028901 = ~Hmmn... yes, this will do just fine. Here is the gong. Thank you. Um... sorry for the smell on the gong... can't be helped. Ol' Bessie here has a... problem...~ []
@1028903 = ~Hmph. I don't know... where do you humanoids normally get such things? Do they not sell them in your cities? I am not an expert at your ways.~ []
@1028907 = ~It is your custom, humanoids, to perform trade... is it not? I use this gong, even if it is not for something important. I expect something in return if I am going to give it up.~ []
@1028915 = ~Yes, I have. Here... let's trade.~ []
@1028917 = ~No... but you're going to give me that gong... right NOW.~ []
@1028918 = ~No... but I'm going to keep looking.~ []
@1028920 = ~Greetings, humanoid. Make yourself welcome, as I have said earlier. Please excuse me, however... I am quite busy at the moment.~ []
@1028923 = ~I don't understand... why aren't you attacking me?~ []
@1028924 = ~No... I'll be on my way.~ []
@1028925 = ~Greetings to you, my <BROTHERSISTER>, and welcome to a refuge for the suffering and those in need. Ilmater offers shelter and healing to all who desire it... what is it that I can do for you?~ []
@1028929 = ~Of course, my <BROTHERSISTER>... please come with me.~ []
@1028931 = ~As you can see, there is much call for the Crying God's compassion here in Athkatla. We would ask that you give, if you can afford... if not, it is no matter.~ []
@1028942 = ~Have you seen the theater at the Five Flagons? I hear the troupe, there, puts on quite an excellent show.~ []
@1028946 = ~I hear there's been several kidnappings within the last few months... and none of them ever turned up, even though the ransom was paid!~ []
@1028947 = ~The weather's been quite foul over the last few weeks... storms, hail and fog a'plenty. It's a wonder we get any sea traffic at all.~ []
@1028954 = ~It is called the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, fool. And we do more to battle evil than you could comprehend. Look to your own actions, first, before you look to others'.~ []
@1028955 = ~My goodness... so many men in uniforms, here, I hardly know where to start!~ []
@1028971 = ~Mmmm... you, there... you're a Thayvian, aren't you? I've heard some very good things about the men from Thay...~ []
@1028982 = ~Heh. There do be certain advantages to possessing a smaller stature... foremost among them be easier access to the honeypot pleasures of the female. Heh heh.~ []
@1028988 = ~(mumble) ... Mmm... where be the l'il serving wench?...~ []
@1028990 = ~(mumble) ... Eh? Who be you? You nar be me wife, are ye?... (shudder) ... I nay'er want t' see that battleaxe tonight, aye?...~ []
@1028992 = ~(mumble) ... Have a seat if ye likes...~ []
@1028993 = ~(mumble) ... Buy me an ale, aye?...~ []
@1028997 = ~Ew... a commoner peasant! Out, out at once!!~ []
@1028999 = ~Excuse me, my <LADYLORD>... but this IS our room you are intruding into? I would request that you leave.~ []
@1029000 = ~Oh, it's not so bad now, is it? You've got a close approximation of what you need, and I have fair compensation for the demand on the item.~ []
@1029001 = ~Hmm... you wouldn't be the room service, would you?~ []
@1029004 = ~The price for that knowledge is 1,000 gold. Do you wish to pay that instead?~ []
@1029015 = ~Tsk, tsk. Not even a challenge anymore. The big folk are getting more than a little inbred.~ []
@1029019 = ~Perhaps I should just ask about your source. That was 1,000 gold, wasn't it?~ []
@1029022 = ~Why, hello there... so nice to see someone of decent culture in this little horrid inn. Too bad we have no servants with us to host you properly.~ []
@1029025 = ~Ah... if you are one of the servants, I would like a cup of elven wine, please. And perhaps a bit of pheasant, too... I'm feeling peckish.~ []
@1029030 = ~I have no home but th' mud in th' streets... except that I am allowed t' stay in the temple, sometimes.~ []
@1029032 = ~Please, me <LADYLORD>... could ye spare a bit o' coin for a sinner in need? Please... but a single coin would do!~ []
@1029037 = ~I... understand, my <LADYLORD>. Go in peace wi' ye.~ []
@1029045 = ~Then your unkindness was thoughtless and undeserved. Please... go.~ []
@1029051 = ~I have seen the Crying God heal many... and demand nothing in return. He is a glorious and benevolent god, indeed.~ []
@1029052 = ~Ilmater helps those in need... all of us in the slums could use his aid, I think.~ []
@1029054 = ~Praise Oghma, the beneficent master of knowledge, invention and inspiration. Come, seeker, and be welcome within his temple. What can I provide for you?~ []
@1029064 = ~Oghma teaches that knowledge must be collected and disseminated, and wisdom applied to its use. The Wise God teaches that ideas must never be stifled.~ []
@1029073 = ~This is not illithium! You have cheated my art! Illithium holds no oil or grime! A handprint on illithium is an impossibility!~ [SARLES08]
@1029075 = ~We seek to spread knowledge and to curb falsehood and rumor... especially with regards to history.~ []
@1029079 = ~The things that are studied in the Oghmanyte orders are far beyond most people's comprehension. We shall teach them... in time.~ []
@1029085 = ~Of course, my <BROTHERSISTER>... please come with me.~ []
@1029094 = ~The most important element of illithium is that it will bear no dirt or grime! Cast as illithium, my work need never show the taint of another mortal's hands!~ []
@1029097 = ~Then it should have been nothing! I have made my wishes clear, and you have made a mockery of them!~ []
@1029099 = ~I can hardly ever sleep well... I have bad dreams in the night. But sometimes Ilmater comes to me and comforts me and I sleep real good.~ []
@1029100 = ~I was assured it had the same attributes as your metal.~ []
@1029102 = ~Gosh, <SIRMAAM>... could you... afford a little gold piece? I am so hungry and it's hours until we eat...~ []
@1029109 = ~... I... yes, <SIRMAAM>... I'm s-sorry...~ []
@1029110 = ~My mommy died giving me birth, and my daddy died in the war. They left me all alone... an' I was sent here.~ []
@1029119 = ~... I... I'm sorry... I just want my mommy...~ []
@1029133 = ~I don't see why. This new piece is a welcome understatement. Looks as though it represents the shadows receding from the dawn. Fine work.~ []
@1029191 = ~Nowhere. This place is unfriendly to even the pathetic dwarves of hill and mountain. Alright, fool, you wish to share my problem, I'll give it to you.~ []
@1029192 = ~Nothing. Very few opportunities for mercantile trade in this place when you are even a hill or mountain dwarf. Alright, fool, you wish to share my problem, I'll give it to you.~ []
@1029193 = ~You want illithium, you can wait for it. We mine it deep in the earth, and it's dangerous going. It's rare enough when production is normal.~ []
@1029198 = ~You want to go chasing after him, that's your business. It's lost to me anyway. I show my face and he'll have the guards on me just for being duergar.~ []
@1029199 = ~ Ah Hah!~ [MAZZY36]
@1029202 = ~ Ach... missed!~ [MAZZY37]
@1029208 = ~Spider Spawn (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 4
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell, the wizard conjures one or two fully grown spiders to do his or her bidding. The type of spiders that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.

7th: giant spider
9th: phase spider
12th and up: sword spider

When the spell is cast there is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one. These spider(s) will remain under the wizard's control until slain, or until the spell duration expires.~ []
@1029214 = ~Summon Nishruu (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

With this spell, the wizard may summon a Nishruu, a magical being of considerable power. At first glance, a Nishruu appears to be some sort of mist; closer examination will reveal a boiling, churning red mass of vapors and shapes that moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to flame, the Nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner, even though it would like nothing better. Each time a Nishruu wraps its tendrils around a target, there are two major effects. First, all charged magical items possessed by the target will be drained by one charge, destroying them if only one charge remains. Second, the affected wizard will lose one memorized spell, chosen at random from the highest possible spell level. Excluding Death Spell and Death Fog, the Nishruu is completely immune to magic; further, magic will actually heal this creature. The Nishruu will remain under the wizard's control until killed, or until the spell duration expires.~ []
@1029220 = ~Summon Hakeashar (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 8 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is similar to the 6th level wizard spell Summon Nishruu. The Hakeashar is a more powerful version of the Nishruu, having more hit points, better attacks, and immunity to normal weapons. With this spell, the wizard may summon a Hakeashar, a magical being of considerable power. At first glance, a Hakeashar appears to be some sort of mist; closer examination will reveal a boiling, churning red mass of vapors and shapes that moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to flame, the Hakeashar feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner, even though it would like nothing better. Each time a Hakeashar wraps its tendrils around a target, there are two major effects. First, all charged magical items possessed by the target will be drained by one charge, destroying them if only one charge remains. Second, the affected wizard will lose one memorized spell, chosen at random from the highest possible spell level. Excluding Death Spell and Death Fog, the Hakeashar is completely immune to magic; further, magic will actually heal this creature. The Hakeashar will remain under the wizard's control until killed, or until the spell duration expires.~ []
@1029243 = ~Young fools want a god to walk with them, but that is not the way. It demeans a god to walk with the flock, just as if I supped with insects.~ []
@1029270 = ~It is a beholder cult! The 'worshippers' are probably magically enslaved.~ []
@1029275 = ~May The Destroyer guide your hand in the battle to come.~ []
@1029279 = ~Serving Talos and living through the experience was reward enough.~ []
@1029292 = ~Insanity! You... you tempt the fates like a mad<MANWOMAN>! Perhaps you will serve with your mindlessness, but you will never be of the chosen.~ []
@1029293 = ~Talos would have welcomed you to the ranks of his chosen, but you have turned away. Madness.~ []
@1029305 = ~But nothing is ever easy. Aside from his enormous commission fee, he claims he will work in nothing short of pure illithium - a metal more valued than gold!!~ []
@1029321 = ~You will have to secure enough illithium to keep him happy, and convince him to accept an affordable commission. Discuss this with Sarles, he may be reasonable.~ []
@1029322 = ~The Unsleeping Eyes of Helm have much to keep them busy now! We have received word that Sarles will work for us! I cannot thank you enough.~ []
@1029324 = ~But mere gold is not worthy of your service. You are of the chosen of Helm. You deserve greater tools with which to spread the word of Helm.~ []
@1029356 = ~There is more to be done. An artist visits Athkatla now. Only Prism of Nashkel was more accomplished, but his work was sickly sweet and his death deserved.~ []
@1029361 = ~Convince him to work for Talos. Use whatever means you must. Other churches are trying the same... if you cross their representatives, kill them.~ []
@1029370 = ~You are as much use as Talos sees fit! Do you refuse this task?~ []
@1029374 = ~Find his damnable illithium and make him accept a reasonable commission. He may rethink his demands if you press our point in discussion with him.~ []
@1029392 = ~What is the disturbance, Talon? Talos alone reserves fury in his own temple. Ahh, is this to be the new tribute you have commissioned?~ []
@1029399 = ~Well, he'll kill us both if I tell him now. You are very lucky, though perhaps Talos did guide you through this mire.~ []
@1029407 = ~Aye, burn the elf! Her dark and fiendish kin rose up from their underground homes and killed my father and brother! They are all evil, I tell you! All of them!~ [VICG201]
@1029419 = ~As ye will. (Can't read, eh? 'Tis a fine pickle the Amnish school system's get itself into.)~ []
@1029425 = ~What are you doing?! Why have ye interfered with the judgement of Beshaba?! Her will must be shown to the people!~ [VICG107]
@1029431 = ~And lo, the judgment of Beshaba has been called upon this most evil of drow, and she has been found wanting! May the people see their salvation from your evil in the Maid of Misrule! Pray that she is merciful, foul one!~ [VICG106]
@1029433 = ~Huzzah! Huzzah!!~ [VICTO302]
@1029436 = ~I owe you my life, abbil... you have saved me once again. I did nothing to provoke their attack, I tell you! I was passing through the city when the man guessed my identity under my hood.~ [VICONIB3]
@1029437 = ~I was surprised and he called out to others, revealing me. I suppose they assumed I was here to spy on them... fools! They are so quick to fear, these rivvin!~ []
@1029438 = ~But, come... we must be on our way soon if we are to avoid drawing another crowd. I distrust these barbaric people too much to hang about.~ []

@1029452 = ~I found the stinking drow in the market, hiding under her cloak and hood, sneaking amongst us surely for an evil purpose! She'll pay, all right... just like all of her kind will one day pay!~ []
@1029454 = ~I do as Talos wills!~ []
@1029458 = ~This drow is just like all the rest, I reckon... if we don't burn her now, she'll murder any one of us soon enough!~ []
@1029459 = ~She was up to no good, she was! Sneakin' around the markets, hidin' from us in her cloaks! A spy... or an assassin! Burn, I says!!~ []
@1029460 = ~This is only right and fair... all the drow elves are evil to the core and this one is surely no exception! This will show them that we can't be pushed around!~ []
@1029463 = ~Oh my... I wonder if this drow means we are to be invaded by an army of them, soon! Black elves bursting from the ground! Oooohh...~ []
@1029466 = ~The High Mornmaster of the Lathander has sent word you are to be congratulated. You have done well by helping the balance of power here.~ []
@1029467 = ~Very well... I think I'll enjoy this.~ []

@1031842 = ~Of course I do. Ah, but I see I have upset you, my dove. Let me reassure you that the multiverse shall not end in my lifetime... at least I do not expect it to.~ []
@1031843 = ~And while I know that our love must end, I do not expect it to do so soon. The Fates will decide, and until then I shall love you truly and with all the heart I can muster.~ []

Ending the Plague of Teeth

This tome is quite ancient, and you do not recognize the tongue in which it is written. Fortunately, Bodhi has scrawled a translation of selected passages in the margins, as well as further questions she apparently wished to ask on the subject.

Stuat tuo Gotha: 
The resolution:
With the witch at the fore, long previous to her treachery, we did stride the hills of Umar seeking comfort in our hour of need. The time had come for the living to mourn no more, and the blades that were fettered by sentiment were cut free, and it was decided that we would speak for our lives with the sinews of our sword arms. The honored dead that did take flight in the darkness of shadow would no more receive sorrow from those of us that had lost their friends and relatives to the plague of teeth. 

Mornat de'pas Golvana Fathorn:
Battles when came the dead:
There came we, the army of light, armed with faith and conviction, and we did march unto the tombs of the restless dead during hours of day. With wooden edge we struck down master and slave, though many paid for each thrust with their lives. In the fallen there was the danger of a scourge anew, and many of the newly infected seemed doomed to walk again with dire purpose. 

Aegato Davon:
The plea:
"No more" cried we! No more would we lose to the plague. These new fallen could not be abandoned. We had fought for our lives and theirs, and they would not be taken. To the Temple we went, to the god of Sun and Light. Amaunator would save them. Amaunator, whose touch turns shadows to fire. In the arms of the Sun god were the infected placed, and the hearts of their dark masters were laid there with them. Blood did burn, and the dead returned, but not as undead or unliving, but alive and freed from taint. Many did walk the light side home, when last the plague did fall.

Relevance of archaic worship of Amaunator?
Origin of vampiric plague?
Any link to a modern cure to be worried of?
Historical document or historical fiction?

A final note is scribbled...

@1031868 = ~I give up... I can't go on... there's no point... I must die~ []
@1031873 = ~Excellent, I look forward to seeing what you can do. Return to Mae'Var's vacant office. I will have it seeded with a few promising young thieves.~
@1031876 = ~This is the ornate coffin of the vampire Dace. Strange markings on the side, upon closer inspection, turn out to be the word 'Madness' etched over and over again, covering the coffin.~ []
@1031884 = ~Aerie, my dove... are you well?~ [HAERDA79]
@1031885 = ~I've just... I've just been thinking. About all this death, all these... horrifying things Irenicus has done. He actually stole a soul and... and all these people died for nothing...~ [AERIE86]
@1031886 = ~And for what? Some 'vengeance' that Irenicus wants! For that he throws people aside like mere objects?! I... I cannot believe that such evil is allowed to exist!~ []
@1031887 = ~Haer'Dalis! We must scour the face of Faerun of such foulness! The very stink of it clogs my every breath! No mercy! No mercy must be shown to such evil!!~ []
@1031888 = ~And you, <CHARNAME>... I now see much of the same mark of evil in you. I will watch you carefully. You have earned my respect, but I will not tolerate the callousness I see in you any longer.~ []
@1031889 = ~False friend! I am loath to think that I have lent my hand to your cause. I shall go to my father without you! Pray that our paths do not cross again!~ [ANOMENC5]

@1031994 = ~Errrm... hello? I don't recognize you... you must be new to Imnesvale. Is there something I can help you with?~ [MINIST02]
@1031995 = ~Actually, I spoke to a boy by the name of Delon in Athkatla... he said you were in need of assistance.~ []
@1031996 = ~I saw your speech outside of the village... you in need of an adventurer?~ []

@1032049 = ~It's the ogres, my husband... you know it is.~ []
@1032050 = ~Errrrm... my wife, Eina. And, yes... many people think it's that group of ogres who moved into the area just before the killings began. Likely is, too.~ []
@1032052 = ~And still others claim Umar, herself... the great witch of the hills... has returned. Legend has it she was responsible for deaths much like these ones.~ []
@1032053 = ~They're in the hills... too close to the village, I say!~ []

@1032112 = ~You can continue with all your thieves in prison, but you will get no profit. No use getting mad at me... if I die, the guild fails. I have Renal's ear, you see.~ []

@1032333 = ~Bloody mayor hired a halfling runt and her troupe to find out what's been happenin'. They haven't come back... wolves ripped 'em apart is my guess.~ []
@1032336 = ~Alright. How high of a quota should be set for him? This will of course mean burgling more or less houses, so there may be increased risk to him.~ []
@1032345 = ~Led by a big ogre fellow... Madulf,  I think. Wants to be left alone. Fact that he'd talk first rather than kill ye makes him not th' worst sort in my books.~ []

@1032374 = ~Dead, good sir. An ignoble death, as well... I hope you appreciate that they died in an effort to bring your safety.~ []

(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None 

When cast, this spell causes all creatures within a 10 foot radius of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient performs any action which cancels it, or until 24 hours have passed. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, or attack without immediately becoming visible, although the invisibility does enable them to attack first.~ []

@1032606 = ~Nay, my lady. I'd happily settle in your hamlet and be your ranger, but I doubt that it will be my destiny.~ []
@1032612 = ~Ah! A good day to you, <SIRMAAM>... it is nice to see a new face in the village, for once. We haven't had many travelers through here since all these killings began, naturally.~ []
@1032615 = ~People don't need to get hurt in these deals.~ []
@1032617 = ~I'd be pleased to show you some of the goods I have to sell, although I must warn you... our mercantile company hasn't had much opportunity to deliver lately, so goods are spare.~ []
@1032622 = ~Ah! Now that's a tale and a half. Mind you... don't listen to the dribble these villagers might tell you... they'd have you half-believing that a five-hundred-year-old witch is on the prowl.~ []
@1032640 = ~Always willing to satisfy a customer... with gold, that is.~ []
@1032642 = ~Well... some people still think the problem can be solved. I hear the mayor hired a band of adventurers to look into it, but they've disappeared.~ []

@1032644 = ~I will inform Varia of your directions.~ []

@1032654 = ~Good to see you again, <SIRMAAM>. Since you saved this village, things have returned to normal, which is a mighty good thing. I'm grateful, for one... as is my company.~ []
@1032657 = ~Especially considering the fact that I know you engineered that deal with Madulf and his fellows. Never would o' thought to sell goods to an ogre, but there it is... and he's a fair bargainer, too.~ []

@1032689 = ~(sigh)  I just know that one of these days, one of those ogres is going to come down and massacre me, just like those other villagers. I... I never thought of something like this when I became a merchant!~ []
@1032695 = ~Hanz has returned with a nice profit. His task was dangerous, but his skill has brought him through unscathed.~ []
@1032698 = ~Very well, I will have him released as soon as possible. You will have to reassign him his tasks when I am done reporting on the others.~ []
@1032700 = ~Oh, I suppose so... but there isn't much. Caravans just won't come here unless they're stocked with guards... and that doesn't make it very profitable, now, does it?~ []
@1032701 = ~Ohhh, it's a terrible thing, isn't it? People dying left and right... you can hardly find a customer anymore, and that's probably okay because nobody will restock me, now, anyway.~ []
@1032706 = ~Somebody should do something about those ogres, though. Ever since they came, it all started. One of my caravans once got attacked by ogres... they're evil and brutal!~ []
@1032708 = ~Let's check on how Goshan did under your instruction.~ []
@1032711 = ~Al-alright... just... just be careful of those hungry ogres!~ []
@1032712 = ~I... I can't tell you how relieved I am that you've stopped all the killings! I was sure I was a goner! Maybe now people will start coming back to the village.~ []
@1032713 = ~And... and I met my first ogre face-to-face. He... he wanted to buy some apples that I had shipped up from my orchard outside Athkatla. I was sure he was going to eat me, instead, but he didn't.~ []
@1032714 = ~Well, anyway... did you wish to buy something?~ []
@1032722 = ~Goshan has survived all you have put before him and returned with a tidy sum, though I am sure he is not grateful for the risk of his tasks.~ []
@1032724 = ~Very well, I will have him released as soon as possible. You will have to reassign him his tasks when I am done reporting on the others.~ []
@1032725 = ~Then Goshan will stay locked up until you say and pay otherwise.~ []
@1032733 = ~Well, me name's Dale... I do some herdin' out in the fields with the cows and such with me wife, here, and me kids. Came into the village... just ain't safe anymore out there.~ []
@1032735 = ~I knows two other herders who vanished. An' the farmers ain't safe, neither. Farmer Jacob an' his wife were both slaughtered... and then their bodies disappeared. Turrible things, all.~ []
@1032741 = ~Kretor has proven quite resourceful. Your conditions were difficult, but he has met them and returned with a fair amount of gold.~ []
@1032744 = ~Very well, I will have him released as soon as possible. You will have to reassign him his tasks when I am done reporting on the others.~ []
@1032745 = ~Kretor will rot with the other guttertrash in a pauper's prison until you say otherwise.~ []
@1032746 = ~Kretor has been killed. Nothing more to be said about it.~ []
@1032749 = ~People gets hysterical, they does. Groos, there, babbles on about that witch... and me daughter, Kaatje, is no better with her stories. Ye should hear her, heh.~ []
@1032750 = ~It's the ogres... and they'll come an' finish us all off once 'ey've picked us clean to small enough numbers. We should be fleein' as soon as we can, true enough.~ []
@1032751 = ~You just watch yerself around here... them ogres'll be the death of us all, they will.~ []
@1032757 = ~I think I remember someone mentionin' an old cabin in the hills not far from here, but I don't know anythin' more about it. Ask Groos, maybe... he goes that way more'n I do.~ []
@1032760 = ~Morsa kept her activities to a minimum, transporting only small amounts of contraband. Her return is accordingly small.~ []
@1032762 = ~Morsa responded well to this level of challenge, and has returned with a tidy sum of gold. It was risky, but she came through just fine in the end.~ []
@1032765 = ~Very well, I will have her released before the day is out. You will have to reassign her tasks to her when I am done reporting on the others.~ []
@1032766 = ~Then she will stay locked up until you can put up the gold.~ []
@1032770 = ~Err... hullo. Don't meet a lot o' strangers around here. 'Specially as o' late.~ []
@1032781 = ~Varia has been taken prisoner by the guards. They do not approve of her blackmail tactics, and it will cost a 300 gold bribe to get her out.~ []
@1032783 = ~Then Varia will languish in prison until she is freed.~ []
@1032784 = ~Varia is no longer alive. It is a great loss.~ []
@1032786 = ~Now then, that's all of them. Do not forget to give the quota master his dues, or Renal will close down the guild. He does not wait for long.~ []
@1032787 = ~The mayor sent some people out to find out what's happenin'... but I know what's goin' on. It's Umar... the witch is come back and there ain't no one who goes into the hills going t' come back, now.~ []
@1032796 = ~I knows plenty more than I wants to, believe me. The murders... skin missin', bodies disappearin'... it's the very things that happened when Umar ruled these lands, y'see. She's come back.~ []
@1032798 = ~There's lots of land owned by them old families. They all thought there was mithril, here, long time ago. Half right, I suppose... there was a little, and it ran out right quick.~ []
@1032799 = ~Little mines and temples went an' got swallowed up by the trees... all the families went an' left it all behind. Some kept a little piece o' land here an' there... like the cabin yer talkin' about.~ []
@1032800 = ~It's in the hills, it is... not far but inaccessible. There's a ranger fella that goes out there warned me not to get too close to the cabin. Set out lots of traps, he says.~ []
@1032801 = ~I gets the sense that the fella's hidin' scared there. Shame... seems nice enough. Can't be rich, though... probably just usin' the cabin that was already there.~ []
@1032802 = ~I'd show ya exactly where, but there ain't no way I'm going back into the hills until Umar has had her fill. Which may be never... so there it is.~ []
@1032803 = ~Okay. Don't go into the hills, though... just a friendly warnin'.~ []
@1032804 = ~She's a powerful old witch... ruled these hills over five hundred years ago. Disappeared... no one knows where to, but she's come back, that's for sure.~ []
@1032805 = ~People 'round here... they don't believe me, I know. But they don't go deep into the hills where I go. Late at night... ye hears things not o' this world, and it makes ye believe anythin' is possible.~ []
@1032807 = ~Um... hello, my <LADYLORD>. 'Tis a bad time you picked to visit our fair village.~ []
@1032811 = ~My... my name is Margie. Short for Margaret. My husband is Dale... one of the herders. We fled from the outskirts of the village lands because of the wolves.~ []
@1032814 = ~The wolves have picked this year to start in on us people... mauling and stealing corpses. It has... it has been just ghastly. They've been around for several years, but they've never been this bad.~ []
@1032815 = ~Everyone gets so upset and frightened... and they start thinking things are happening that aren't. Some people are blaming the ogre and his band... but they haven't done anything to harm us.~ []
@1032817 = ~The wolves around here have always been a danger... they're large and they're smart. And they're just a danger once again... that's all there is to it. People should know better.~ []
@1032820 = ~This is not excited. I am merely eager to receive your guild quota. Renal awaits it. He wishes to see if you are a profitable guild master. If not, someone else will be appointed.~ []
@1032824 = ~I am afraid that I must ask for a total of 1,000 gold this time. Renal demands hard sacrifices from all his guild underlings and you are no different.~ []
@1032825 = ~Once again we must all tighten our belts and pay what we can. Renal asks for a quota of 1,000 gold. It is hard, but fair.~ []
@1032830 = ~Ahh, unfortunately I must ask you for 1,000 gold this week. I know it is a lot, but Renal demands that his guilds all pitch in when the need is great.~ []
@1032845 = ~It is a small amount to pay to support the greater guild as a whole.~ []
@1032847 = ~That is quite a lot, but I will pay it cheerfully.~ []
@1032849 = ~A pleasure doing business with you. Renal will be most pleased with your performance. I wish you well.~ []
@1032856 = ~What if I am unable to get back to the guild?~ []
@1032857 = ~I will pay you as soon as I can.~ []
@1032876 = ~You cannot cast multiple instances of the same contingency spell on yourself.~ []
@1032881 = ~Ahh, you return. Obviously you have come to your senses and will pay the quota that Renal is due.~ []
@1032882 = ~I think 5,000 gold will suffice, don't you? It will more than make up for the payments you have missed.~ []
@1032883 = ~Perhaps 4,000 gold will suffice. It will revitalize my faith in you as a provider for your guild.~ []
@1032888 = ~Well, it's good to have you back with us. Consider your guild resanctioned. Go take good care of it this time.~ []
@1032892 = ~So, you be me new boss then? Fair enough. We ain't had time to talk yet, so let me tells ya something. You be square with me and I'll be square with you.~ []
@1032893 = ~I'm not stressing one bit with the current way things are handled. I think it's a bit of a waste of me talents, but who am I to say.~ []
@1032898 = ~I gotta say, <CHARNAME>, I really appreciates you bribing me back onna street. Don't like them closed-in places one bit. You're okay in my books, you are. Keep the work up good.~ []
@1032901 = ~How did you get into this business of yours, Hanz?~ []
@1032914 = ~Things are currently very easy for me, and I would not mind a quickening of the pace. Of course I would be worried about risk, but I think I can bring success to any mission.~ []
@1032919 = ~Your assistance in freeing me was most appreciated. Be assured that I will work all the harder for the guild. I will serve loyally and without fail. There is no other guild that compares.~ []
@1032925 = ~A pleasure as always, <CHARNAME>. Is there anything I can do to service the guild in any way?~ []
@1032928 = ~And how did you come by the Shadow Thieves?~ []
@1032930 = ~It is only as bloody as you let it get. If I must wash my hands after a kill, I have been less effective than I could have.~ []
@1032947 = ~I knows my place, and I'll do my job as you say. Nothing says I gotta like it. Get on, you've got some guildmaster business or somesuch to do. Don't waste your time talking to me.~ []
@1032953 = ~Things are a little slow right now, but if you think it's best for us to conserve our skill, that's okay by me. It's all up to you.~ []
@1032957 = ~It's pretty boring just sitting around, but if you don't want me out and about, that's okay too. I've been catching up on my reading. Did you know that bats see with sound? Neat.~ []
@1032969 = ~I think my talents are currently wasted here. Playing it safe all around is pointless. The profits are small, and the thrills are nonexistent. Get things moving around here.~ []
@1032971 = ~Now we're up to some fun, though there's more coin out there, I can smell it. We should be risking it all, instead of holding back like some common gutter trash.~ []
@1032976 = ~Just give me a report on how things are going.~ []
@1032994 = ~Ahh, the new guild leader. I trust you will find the facilities to your liking.~ [LATHAN02]
@1032998 = ~You are new, so there is little on the agenda just yet. I will try to inform you when something comes up.~ []
@1032999 = ~Nothing to report just yet.~ []
@1033001 = ~My name is Ama, and I am Shadowmaster of eastern Esmeltaran. Here is my signet, I think you'll find it authentic. Now stand aside!~ []

@1033005 = ~Why are you so far afield of your home city?~ []
@1033010 = ~I have come here with a promise of granting his wishes, but I only want to lure him away from his palisade defenses. This is where you come in.~ []
@1033011 = ~I have come to try and end the meddling of a politician that has grown too big for himself.~ []
@1033023 = ~It will be any evening that is best for you. I will await you in Waukeen's Promenade after dark, and then dispense a runner to get Sir Greshal. The suddenness will seem dramatic to him.~ []
@1033033 = ~Just wait a little longer. I'm sure he'll be here soon. He'll want us in full view and unarmed.~ []
@1033034 = ~Ahh, here he comes now.~ []
@1033039 = ~You have fallen for the trap, taken the bait. Now you are vulnerable, and my assassins are in place! Let the Night Masks take you!~ []
@1033041 = ~Er, hello. I... I had you followed and... and I'm awfully sorry about the mess with that Ama person. My informant tells me her cohorts wore the insignia of the Night Masks.~ []
@1033049 = ~We are the knights of honor and good upon Ansalon, a world so far removed from this one.~ []
@1033059 = ~Traps? No, but in the dark rooms of this place I have witnessed horrors. These terrors I am loath to discuss but if it helps your cause then I shall.~ []
@1033061 = ~To the west we were ambushed by small creatures, children in size but not in appetite. We were hard pressed to battle our way out of the trap.~ []
@1033064 = ~Halflings? If halflings seek to rip and rend the flesh from your body, to swallow your flesh and suck the marrow from your bones, then halflings they may be.~ []

Kaatje came to visit again. A sweet child, eager to learn my ways with the wild creatures.

Flamerule 12
Dark creatures roam the forests. Several townspeople have been slain by some unknown predator. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of what is doing the killing. The strangest thing is that the bodies are disappearing in the morning. This leaves me baffled, for most signs point to a pack of wolves that have been in the area for a long time. Wolves don't steal bodies.

Flamerule 13
Or perhaps I should say wolf-like creatures. At night while I've been patrolling I've often caught shadowy glimpses of these 'wolves' running alongside me. I've tried to attract their attention but they ignore me. I find this most strange, as if the pack is being controlled by someone else. Years ago I spoke with the pack leaders and they were cordial. Now they either flee from me, or, and I fear to say this, they stalk me.

Flamerule 21
It is near noon and still the wood outside my cabin seems full of shadows. I've been hard pressed to hear birds and most of the larger animals have long fled. I plan to find the wolf's den (this afternoon). I've drawn a map to it. All signs point to them as being the culprits, but what wolves act like these? They are wolves with the cunning of men.
And there is something else, a whispering in my mind. It is faint now, in the waking hours, but while I sleep I dream only of this voice and the face behind it. Whether it is connected to the voices, I do not know. I suspect by the time that the sun sets tonight I'll have answers to my questions.~ []

@1034090 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."
It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.
As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

NOTE:  Magical two-handed weapons are more powerful than their single-handed counterparts. This counter balances the fact that you can't use a second weapon or shield when using a two handed weapon. The Holy avenger and Vorpal sword are examples of weapons that are two-handed. 

This weapon class allows the character to use a two-handed melee weapon and receive special bonuses. If one slot is spent on this proficiency the wielder gets a +1 bonus to damage and a -2 bonus to speed when using a two-handed weapon. A second slot spent on this proficiency gives a further -2 bonus to speed while wielding two-handed weapons. The character will also score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20). Two-handed missile weapons (bows and crossbows) are not affected by this proficiency.~ []
@1034172 = ~Solve the riddle in the sewers.

According to Quallo, Vallah's hand represents suffering... which is of prime importance. Presumably he is referring to its order in the pipes.~ []
@1034173 = ~SWORD AND SHIELD:  Anyone can pick up a shield and get its basic protection bonuses, but by spending slots on this proficiency an adventurer can maximize the benefits received. One slot spent gives a -2 bonus to AC against missile weapons. Another slot spent increases the bonus to a total of -4.

NOTE:  Despite the name of this skill, any one-handed weapon in combination with a shield will receive the bonuses given by this skill.~ []
@1034174 = ~SINGLE WEAPON:  This weapon class is for characters who do not wish to use a shield but want some bonus when using a one-handed melee weapon. With one slot spent on this proficiency, the wielder gets a -1 bonus to AC and inflicts critical damage on an attack roll of 19 or 20, if using a single weapon. A second slot increases the AC bonus to a total of -2. One-handed missile weapons (such as slings) are not affected by this proficiency.~ []

@1034231 = ~The return to Harper Hold.

I met up with Jaheira at the Harper Hold, and she relayed to me that the Harpers there were not truly Harpers anymore... the lack of the specters on the second floor attested to this. She suggested that perhaps this was a splinter group seeking revenge, but was not sure.

I was willing to take her out of the place, but not to have her rejoin with my group. Disappointed and perhaps angry that I would leave her in a trap, she left to escape on her own. I doubt I will see her again.~ []
@1034233 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Embarl mentioned that he had overheard Mae'Var planning on assassinating Renal... I wonder if this is something Renal would want to hear. Regardless, I've no proof to offer him.~ []
@1034234 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Embarl is dead, for good or ill... I will need to bring Mae'Var his dagger in order to prove that the deed is done.~ []
@1034235 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Mae'Var trusts me well enough, and has accepted me into the guild. Perhaps now I have time to look around and see if there is any evidence to be had. Edwin might know something, but only if it is in his best interests, I am sure.~ []
@1034238 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Edwin assures me that the letter I have taken from Mae'Var's room is the right one... and has bade me go to Renal with great speed!~ []
@1034243 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Mae'Var has been exposed and his execution ordered... once he is dead I must return to Renal and tell him that the deed is done.~ []
@1034247 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The lieutenant mentioned that there was a series of grisly murders occurring in the Bridge District. Someone is murdering the poor in the streets and removing their skins in a hideous fashion. He mentioned that a child, Faraji, saw the most recent victim... and also mentioned a beggar, Rampah, and a courtesan, Rose, as being involved in his investigation somehow.~ []
@1034249 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The courtesan, Rose, thought she remembered a smell at the murder scene... she said it was akin to guril berries, but couldn't place it exactly. She directed me to Bel, a merchant, who she stated would know more about things that smelled like the berries and offered to differentiate between the odors that Bel thought of.~ []
@1034252 = ~Bandits! I saw them! Coming! They try not to be seen, but I saw them! Nearly here! Hide and run!~ []
@1034266 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The boy, Faraji, claimed that the victim who was killed was a man by the name of Bilver, and that the fellow had no enemies to speak of. The boy seemed sure that the person responsible was a 'witch' by the name of Missus Cragmoon and that I should go and speak to her... although her so-called crimes seem fairly innocent.~ []
@1034267 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

I spoke to Missus Cragmoon... it seems that, while she is a magic-user (the boy was apparently right about the witch part), she doesn't seem to have anything at all to do with the murders.~ []
@1034269 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The merchant, Bel, identified the strange piece of leather as elephant hide. Certainly difficult to find in this city, although Bel thought that a tanner might be able to get ahold of some. He also mentioned that a circus was in town... while he didn't know if they had elephants or not, the circus animal tamer might also be one who could get such a hide.~ []
@1034271 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

Bel told me that there were three things that smelled like guril berries: guril berries, themselves, as well as oak bark and solik berries. He gave me a sample of each... with which I can probably go back to Rose and get her to compare the odors.~ []
@1034277 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

I informed the lieutenant that the murderer had tannin on him as well as the elephant hide, and the lieutenant decided that the tanner must be responsible for the murders and left to check the matter out. He went by himself... I certainly hope that the lieutenant will be alright.~ []
@1034285 = ~What manner of bandits are you? You have orcs among your number!~ []
@1034287 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

Rejiek was obviously responsible for the murders, according to his own words... and the wizard, Vellin Dahn, in the back of his shop was allied with him and spoke of a larger work that was being performed. I am unsure if this ends here or not, but the Tanner has certainly escaped for now. The mage must have spirited him away.~ []
@1034291 = ~Recover Dennis' mother's gong.

It seems that Dennis isn't quite the culprit Vittorio made him out to be. Vittorio stole the man's gong... or at least his mother's... and I have agreed to go and find the gong and return it. Vittorio says that he sold it to a fence by the name of Roger, who has his shop in the sewers. Dennis will hold onto Vittorio until I return with the gong, apparently.~ []
@1034299 = ~Recover Dennis' mother's gong.

Well, finally! Drush the ogre mage DOES have the gong... he's using it to shovel cow dung, of all things (and, really, what else is a gong good for?) and he's not about to part with it for anything less than a Wand of Frost. He suggested that Adratha, a witch who lives next to him, might have one... but any wand of frost would really do.~ []
@1034300 = ~Recover Dennis' mother's gong.

Drush gave me the gong (and WHEW does it stink!)... I suppose all that remains, now, is to return it to Dennis at Delosar's in Athkatla.~ []
@1034308 = ~Yes, very busy. And so are your clothes... very vividly red, in fact.~ []
@1034329 = ~Lady Jysstev, I must ask a favor of you. There is a little girl that is sick and I think that you may have knowledge that can help her... I need to find the Hidden.~ []

@1034337 = ~Put the spirit of the child Wellyn to rest.

I encountered the restless spirit of a small boy, Wellyn, in the graveyard and agreed to return his stuffed bear to him so that he might be at peace. According to the spirit, the bear (named Littleman... I suppose every halfling child must have a toy named Littleman, if you think about it) is in the possession of the thief who murdered the child... the thief's name is Llynis and is in one of the rooms at the Copper Coronet.~ []
@1034339 = ~What? Is that your only concern? My child is taken and you think only of yourself? Are you sure it was the illusions that dishonored you?~ []
@1034343 = ~I will take vengeance for you as well, no matter where he hides!~ []

Arenthis, the priest, seems to think that the paladin I encountered... Kamir was his name... might make an excellent guardian for his orphaned girl. Kamir thinks himself responsible for his son's death... perhaps he might see this as some kind of atonement... who knows?~ []
@1034386 = ~A Cult of the Eyeless?

Some form of new religion or cult has been formed in the city, centered on a god called 'the Unseeing Eye'. A priest of some kind whose own eyes were missing spoke to a crowd, calling on them to shed their 'false sight' and join in the worship of this new god.~ []
@1034404 = ~Illithium!!?? He told you?? That drunken fool! That simpering idiot! That ale-guzzling worm farmer! Where is he? I'll kill him! (Won't rescue me but will send a bunch of surfacers to loot the place...)~ []

@1034413 = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

I have agreed to investigate the cult of this 'Unseeing Eye' for Mornmaster Arval, high priest of the temple of Lathander. I must investigate as I see fit, infiltrating 'as friend or foe.'  The temple of the cult lies far below ground, apparently, and there should be a passage to it from the sewers... although the Mornmaster could not say exactly where. The Mornmaster also offered me the services of his church, with regards to healing and equipment, should I need them.~ []
@1034418 = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

I've stumbled across Sassar, who was once the high priest for the beholder until he learned of the creature's true intentions. It has come to this place to recover a piece of a powerful rod that lies in the dungeons below, the match to the piece it already has. Many in the cult have been sent below to make the attempt, and all have apparently failed.
Sassar claims that the gods cursed the rod because of its great power, but he couldn't tell me more. He did say, however, that the only way to destroy the beholder would be to use the rod against it. I must retrieve the part of the rod below and then Sassar will tell me how to steal the other half from the beholder.~ []

@1034443 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

I have met with the Hidden in the sewers... a strange and mysterious creature that knew why I was there before I even said anything. He directed me to kill two evil creatures that are hunting him. I can locate them through a contact of theirs... the proprietor of an inn in the Docks District called the Sea's Bounty... he will know me as legitimate if I tell him that I am a 'Seeker'. Once I have done the deed, I am to return to him and he will cure the girl.~ []

Keldorn has become anxious to return to his estate in Athkatla... apparently, he has not seen his family in over a season. I have agreed to go with him. His estate can be found in the Government District, and Keldorn will point it out when we pass.~ []
@1034662 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn's wife has betrayed him by spending her time with another man... a crime that can only be answered by imprisonment. Keldorn wishes to handle the grave task alone... he will return to the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart building in three hours or so, and I can meet him there then.~ []
@1034663 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn is full of grief at discovering that his wife has been spending time with another man. He cannot talk to her... but he can join me in tracking down this Sir William of Thorpe and confronting him. Keldorn said that Sir William frequents the Mithrest, an inn in Waukeen's Promenade.~ []
@1034664 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has left the party to seek out Sir William on his own. He said that if he is not at the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart within two day's time... then he is likely dead. Either way, I should look for him there then.~ []
@1034665 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has left the party to reconcile with his wife. He said he would return to the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart after he was finished, perhaps after three days or so. I will look for him there then.~ []
@1034666 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Regardless of how I might feel about the matter, Keldorn has obviously decided to set affairs right with his wife... and not take retribution against Sir William. I suppose he will want to return to his estate to speak with her soon.~ []

I have acquired a potion from a fellow named Festule the Alchemist to help fight against the ogre. I now have to arrange to have Gorf drink the potion before the fight... Festule suggested that I speak to Bunkin, Gorf's main squeeze.~ []

@1034695 = ~Save Mazzy's sister, Pala

After confronting the evil cleric at the Waukeenar temple, Barl, antidote was found on his body... Pala has been cured, and Mazzy has asked for the evening to remain with her. She says that she will be ready to leave by the next morning, if we are ready by then.~ []

After confronting the evil cleric at the Waukeenar temple, an antidote was found on his body... Pala has been cured, and Mazzy wishes to remain with her sister for an additional day. I cannot afford to wait around, so Mazzy has told me she will remain in Trademeet until I need her again.~ []

@1034719 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

Jan's uncle seems to think that we need the aid of something called 'the Hidden' to heal Lissa's daughter. He directed me to the Lady Jysstev, who lives in an estate in the Government District, saying that she could lead me to it. I should go and tell Jan of this news immediately.~ []

@1035355 = ~I... I have done something most heinous. This killing of Saerk and his... his daughter... I am not sure that I have done the right thing.~ [ANOMEN74]
@1035360 = ~You... you suggested that I take this course of action, my lady. I need your reassurance that there was nothing else that could be done... please.~ []
@1035363 = ~You had to uphold your family's honor, Anomen... nothing is more important than that.~ []
@1035371 = ~Yes... yes, you speak the truth, and I am glad to hear it. That monster would never have paid as he should have for Moira's death!~ []
@1035373 = ~But... still, my lady... it does not sit well with me that I gave into my great hate so easily. Nor that I enjoyed it so much. I thank you for speaking with me of it, though.~ []
@1035374 = ~Yes, I suppose you are correct. I know not how much honor my father has, but I have a duty to my family that I cannot ignore. I... had to do it for Moira, if nothing else.~ []
@1035375 = ~Yes, Saerk had to be destroyed. I am... uncomfortable with the thought of having killed his daughter, but it was his actions that forced me to those extremes.~ []
@1035376 = ~Too far? I did only what I had to... and what you suggested! If I... if I killed the girl, it was only because Saerk forced my hand. It was his fault!~ []
@1035377 = ~I... had a duty to protect my family... to avenge my sister's death. Saerk... had to understand what he had done. I... did my best, <CHARNAME>... and now you abandon me...~ []
@1035378 = ~I no longer know what I should do. I... shall have to think on this. Let us... walk on, for now.~ []
@1035379 = ~I shall try, my lady. I had hoped to receive your good council again as I did to resolve my conflict, before. Perhaps... perhaps another time.~ []
@1035380 = ~My anger has built to the point when I am shaking with pure rage! I... I must speak to you. I must gain some reassurance!~ [ANOMEN75]
@1035383 = ~My father... that rude, drunken bastard! He has cast me out of the family when I was only doing what I must! I cannot take vengeance when there is no proof, and he knows it!~ []
@1035384 = ~And yet... my heart cries out for vengeance! That my sister should lie murdered and the murderer laughs, untouched...! I am so full of hate I can barely control it!~ []
@1035385 = ~Please, my lady... you are the one I turned to for guidance when I was torn. Did I do the right thing? Should the dictates of honor truly overcome duty and justice?!~ []
@1035386 = ~Of course, Anomen... how would you feel if you killed Saerk and found him to be innocent after the fact?~ []
@1035387 = ~It is not your place to seek justice... that is the duty of the law. You did all you could.~ []
@1035388 = ~You must learn to control this anger, Anomen. You knew this was the right path... and it is the way of the Order, as well.~ []
@1035391 = ~Aye... aye, that would be a stain to my honor I surely could not bear. But I still feel so helpless. Surely... surely Saerk will pay, eventually for what he has done.~ []
@1035392 = ~I feel a little better, now, my lady. My thanks for your consolation. Nothing, however, will take away this burning pain in my heart. (sigh)  Let us just move on.~ []
@1035394 = ~I know what you say is true, my lady. But my sister lies cold and unavenged, and the murderer laughs free. Surely the gods will... make him pay. (sigh)  I know I cannot.~ []
@1035395 = ~But you were the one who advised me! How can I rest when I know that there was no other course than for me to avenge my sister! The murderer is free, and my heart cries out for his blood!~ []
@1035397 = ~I... I will have to think on this. It was... the path of honor, and I should be content. But... but... (sigh)  No. I will not speak to you of this. Let us move on, now.~ []
@1035403 = ~It is everything I have strived for... after years spent proving myself. I... don't know what I would do if I failed the Test...~ []
@1035404 = ~And, yet, suddenly I am quite sure that I will fail it. It is my heart that will betray me. I feel faithless and worthless in my soul... and they will know of it.~ []
@1035405 = ~What do you think, my lady? Am I really so terrible? I have tried so hard, and yet it all seems to come to naught. Do you... do you think I will fail the Test, as well?~ []
@1035407 = ~You may... and you should be prepared for such an eventuality.~ []
@1035408 = ~You must be confident that you follow the right path, Anomen. If you follow your conscience, how can they refuse you?~ []
@1035412 = ~You... you truly think so, my lady? It is a pleasure to hear you say such, but I somehow doubt it will be so simple. Even if you are just reassuring me, I do thank you for it.~ []
@1035414 = ~Aaahh... the Test will come for me soon enough, I suppose. And I doubt there is much more I can do between now and then to rectify my failings. What will come will come.~ []
@1035415 = ~Because I do not know my own conscience, my lady. I would not turn to others for guidance if I did... but I do thank you humbly for your council. You are most kind.~ []
@1035416 = ~I suppose that is expected... You cannot counsel my heart, can you? I simply wish that I knew what my own conscience dictated. A worthy knight would know, yes?~ []
@1035418 = ~You have made it plain for me, my lady. As plain as your thinly-disguised contempt for my heart. I will pass or fail the Test, I suppose... but it will be no thanks to you.~ []
@1035424 = ~I have been told a few things of your travels in the north and in Baldur's Gate in particular. Your adventures are... impressive, my lady. The equal of any great heroine.~ []
@1035426 = ~This man, Sarevok... I am told he was your brother. Is this true?~ []
@1035428 = ~Well... he was my half-brother, more or less. We... had the same father.~ []
@1035429 = ~He was my brother in that I am a child of the god, Bhaal, and so was he... if that's what you mean.~ []
@1035433 = ~You... speak so carefully, my lady, because you have been accused of some manner of relation with the dead god of murder, yes? He who was named Bhaal?~ []
@1035434 = ~You need not deny it. I was surprised, however, since you have maintained an honorable existence. I... I cannot imagine what impulses your heritage must fill you with..~ []
@1035435 = ~You need not deny it... I see evidence of this from some of your more base impulses. I do not judge you, however. I, myself, can lay claim to no pure heart.~ []
@1035436 = ~This Sarevok was a man of great power and of similar godly heritage... and yet you maintained the higher road and saved the north from great chaos and destruction.~ []
@1035438 = ~Yes, I know of this. And I can see the signs. I cannot imagine what it must be like... and I can claim no purity, myself, so I can only judge your actions.~ []
@1035443 = ~I am not discussing Sarevok with you, Anomen... nor my activities in the Sword Coast.~ []
@1035446 = ~Aye... and were that I could be so calm about my own. I do wish you would trust me with more details, but I have no need to pry. Forgive me, my lady.~ []
@1035448 = ~Come... let us continue on your journey so that I may think.~ []
@1035449 = ~But you have not always succeeded, yes? I suppose calls of the blood do not need to rule one. Your actions belie whatever motivations you might have... something to ponder.~ []
@1035452 = ~My lady, I have been pondering your situation for some time... this matter of your peculiar heritage... and I find myself filled with admiration and wonder for you, truly.~ [ANOMEN78]
@1035453 = ~The blood of the former god of murder flows through your veins... and yet you are an honorable woman. You have done many great things and have earned respect.~ []
@1035455 = ~My path is quite clear, Anomen. There is no internal struggle... I am not controlled by my blood.~ []
@1035462 = ~Just... just stand away from me, woman! I stand on the precipice of a test that will decide whether my dream dies, and you are not helping! Away from me, so that I might think!~ []
@1035463 = ~Yes... always a struggle. And, yet, you always manage to come out on top, do you not?~ []
@1035464 = ~It must be so easy for you, my lady... you are a force for good and this blood seems to have no powerful influence over you. 'Always a struggle'? Bah!~ []
@1035465 = ~If I had such evil blood in me, I would be writhing on the ground! I... I could not do what you do! Why must I constantly endure this?!~ []
@1035467 = ~I am full of an anger that I cannot quench, yet one that places my soul in peril... and this is something that I should get over? You are a cruel woman, <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1035469 = ~I thought we had become better confidantes than this. I stand on the precipice of a test that will decide whether my dream dies, and you are hesitant to even help me?~ []
@1035470 = ~My lady, I have been pondering your situation for some time... this matter of your peculiar heritage... and I find myself filled with questions that I am almost loath to ask.~ [ANOMEN79]
@1035471 = ~War Hammer +2, +1 electrical: 'Borok's Fist'
Borok Thundercracker was a dwarven hero who led several campaigns against giants and other "tall vermin" that had plagued his people in a number of their communities. This hammer was his blessed weapon, which his elven allies called his "little iron fist," though not to his face.

@1035473 = ~Is there a struggle inside you, my lady? Do you have your rage bottled up inside you, as I do? Is there... is there a fight against evil in your heart?~ []
@1035488 = ~My wife and I... were always close, but lately my business has taken much of my time. It has been difficult, and I knew she was unhappy but... I...~ []
@1035490 = ~I... I am truly sorry, my lady. I asked a question of you, and my response to your answer was nothing short of reprehensible. Please... please forgive me.~ [ANOMEN80]
@1035492 = ~Of course... it is no trouble.~ []
@1035493 = ~Forget it, Anomen. I've received enough abuse from you... and more than enough apologies.~ []
@1035494 = ~Fine, fine... but let's get moving. We haven't time for chit-chat right now.~ []
@1035496 = ~The answer is obvious. Your honor has been maligned. Kill them both for their trespass!~ []
@1035497 = ~She will realize where she belongs, I am sure. Do not make a crisis of this.~ []
@1035513 = ~Joining the Order is important to you, Anomen... you should remain vigilant and steel yourself.~ []
@1035515 = ~Joining the Order is important to you, Anomen... you should remain vigilant and steel yourself.~ []
@1035524 = ~I had simply thought that you were a kindred sort, <CHARNAME>. I see a similar struggle in you... and thought that, as a friend, you might understand me a little.~ []
@1035527 = ~Fine, fine. Let's just continue on... we've no time for this chit-chat.~ []
@1035528 = ~Y-yes... thank you for your understanding, I suppose. I simply wish we had more time to speak. More important matters press, however... let us continue your journey.~ []
@1035530 = ~I appreciate your assistance, but it is most confusing. I shall... try to remain vigilant, as you suggest, but I think I will need to work it out for myself.~ []
@1035532 = ~I am not to worry over joining the Order? Fine advice, now that I sit and regret not paying my duty to my family. Saerk sits alive... on your advice, I might add.~ []
@1035533 = ~I appreciate your assistance, <CHARNAME>, but it is most confusing. Perhaps the Order is not worth such agony... it is something I must devote some thought to on my own.~ []
@1035534 = ~Aye. Your advice has always been constant, pointing me back towards the good. Saerk is alive, which is sad but is the lawful course. And... and the Order is my dream.~ []
@1035536 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>... your kind words gladden me more than I can say. Your advice means much... you are a... a dark flame, my lady, that I am drawn to almost against my will.~ []
@1035537 = ~But 'tis a most pleasurable experience. You have been kind despite my own boorishness. Perhaps one day... we will speak of other things. I... I think I would like that.~ []
@1035538 = ~Mmm. Your view of the Order's tenets are obvious. You advised me to do my duty by my family... and justice was brought to Saerk and his family, as it should have been.~ []
@1035540 = ~Perhaps the Order is not all I have always thought it to be. Perhaps you are right to advise me to worry less... no doubt I would be happier.~ []
@1035545 = ~It seems that you know little of me, after all. I had thought you a kindred spirit. Perhaps... perhaps I was wrong. (sigh)  Let us just... continue and I shall handle my problems myself.~ []
@1035546 = ~Aye, which is no less than I expected. Always I must struggle on my own. You are wise, my lady... as always. I had simply hoped for... for more.~ []
@1035547 = ~Let us just... move on, then, and continue your quest. It will not be long now, anyway, before my Test comes and my questions will be answered for myself.~ []
@1035548 = ~I am glad to hear that, my lady. I see within you one who goes through a similar struggle as I do... although you do not complain about it half as much as I.~ []
@1035555 = ~Freedom (Abjuration) 
Level: 9
Range: Special 
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

NOTE: Cast this spell in an area where you know someone is imprisoned and they will be released.
This spell is the reverse of the ninth level wizard spell Imprisonment. When a creature is imprisoned, he or she is trapped in a sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. If this spell is cast in the area where the imprisonment took place, it will instantly free the victim, who will reappear exactly where he or she was standing prior to being imprisoned. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze.~ []
@1035558 = ~My Test is coming very soon, my lady. I will need to go to the headquarters of the Order and speak to Ryan Trawl. I... I am not looking forward to the judgement I shall receive there.~ []
@1035563 = ~They are fair, my lady. I am not unsettled by the chance they will make the wrong decision... I am unsettled by the chance that they will make the right one.~ []
@1035564 = ~I... have been thinking on what we have spoken of. I have studied to join the Order as long as I can remember, and suddenly I am unsure if I should even want to.~ []
@1035565 = ~I have done as you said, and my wife and I are together once more. She was shamed by her breach of our vows, so we are united in our duty to the sanctity of our commitment again.~ []
@1035566 = ~What if I am accepted into the Order and I find I have no true place in it? And what if I am refused... and I discover the future has no place for me?~ []
@1035568 = ~There is not the spark we once had, but this is a more realistic pairing now. We have put out the fires of our youth. Thank you again.~ []
@1035569 = ~I know, deep down inside, that I have maintained good faith. But... perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps I will only discover too late where my heart truly lies.~ []
@1035570 = ~I... I have done nothing and... and the situation with my wife is unchanged. She grows ever distant. I... thought you should know.~ []
@1035576 = ~I'm sure it won't be that bad... everything will work out as it should.~ []
@1035584 = ~None of us do, of course! These worms are barely worthy of stepping upon the floor of the house of the Storm Lord! Nevertheless, you will hear them!~ []
@1035589 = ~You will not think so after a few whining fools try to beg for gold or some other paltry service.~ []
@1035594 = ~You jest with me, my lady. I think you would do far better in my position. You are a strong woman. I, on the other hand, am too susceptible to my own desires.~ []
@1035596 = ~I have been thinking about Sir Cadril and the Order, and I have decided I am well rid of them! I cannot believe I wasted so much of my life on such ignorant fools!~ [ANOMEN82]
@1035601 = ~That's good to see... you could use a little freedom, I think.~ []
@1035604 = ~Greater Restoration (Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the target is raised, reversing any previous level drain which may have occurred. A restoration spell will also restore the intelligence of a creature affected by a Feeblemind spell. It also negates the negative mental influence of Confusion or being berserk, fully heals the target, and cures any disease or poisons. The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, who likely will require rest immediately afterwards.~ []
@1035614 = ~No, I really don't think you understand. My name is Inspector Ardis, and I work for the city guard. Vilon and I have had an... understanding in the past.~ []
@1035618 = ~Aye, I could at that! Too long has this poor knight frowned and growled... I've enough of it, to tell the truth. I long to laugh and do as I like... and, by Helm, I shall!~ []
@1035620 = ~Well... perhaps a little. I have been part of the Order too long to shrug it off. But I know what is better for my heart. I feel lighter than I have since... since ever, I suppose.~ []
@1035622 = ~But I won't keep a beautiful woman waiting for me to quit my childish gazing about. I've no need to linger and look at pretty things so long as I am traveling with you, my lady.~ []
@1035625 = ~I've come to this point partly from your own advice, <CHARNAME>. You do not like it? Fair enough... I do, and 'tis more than enough for me.~ []
@1035626 = ~Well said and much appreciated by this formerly dour knight, my lady! 'Tis a grand thing to be complimented by a beautiful lady, especially one with your grace.~ []
@1035627 = ~There's much I'd like to see and do... but for now, it will suffice to keep the company of such a grand woman as yourself. Come, let us complete your quest post-haste.~ []
@1035630 = ~My lady... I have been watching you most intently these past few hours and I have come to a conclusion about you. Would you like to hear my thoughts?~ [ANOMEN83]
@1035641 = ~I refrained from telling you how I felt, of course... it is not proper for a knight of the Order to be so unbecoming. But I am under no such restrictions, now.~ []
@1035643 = ~You are a beautiful woman, <CHARNAME>... full of a life that I have always desired. I wish to experience new things, now that I am free... and I wish to be closer to you.~ []
@1035648 = ~A kiss? I... I suppose so...~ []
@1035655 = ~Yes, that was a desirable choice. Their petty problems are hardly worth the ear of the church. Still, I'm sure there could have been greater destruction in the result. Keep this in mind in future.~ []
@1035657 = ~Ha HA! Marvelous! Death, destruction of vows, and coin for the church coffers on top! A fine coup against the forces of order. You will make a fine Stormlord. Here is your share of the reward.~ []
@1035660 = ~I advised a merchant to forgive his wife her transgressions. They are happy now.~ []
@1035665 = ~Then close your eyes, and I shall do the same... we shall meet for a moment as if we were two innocents coming together in the dark. A single brush of our lips, a kiss...~ []
@1035666 = ~... and there... I shall savor this, my dear, this most sweet favor of yours. I know many pretty lines of poetry from my teachings, but I have never known the favor of a woman.~ []
@1035667 = ~Of all the things I might wish to experience, this is the one I most longed for. A promise for what is to come. Let us... continue on, now, lest the others begin to stare.~ []
@1035669 = ~You could turn the world aside with your power and skill as easily as you brush aside my advances... I follow you willingly and with vigor, and I shall continue to do so.~ []
@1035670 = ~You've refused me, of course... no less than I expected. I am a poor excuse for a courtier and a poorer excuse for a lover, but I shall not give up so easily, my lady.~ []
@1035671 = ~You may have captured me, but I am not so helpless... one day, I shall capture you, too. Either that or I am the simple fool that I appear to be, hm? We shall see.~ []
@1035672 = ~Now... let us catch up with our companions before their stares grow more curious.~ []
@1035675 = ~Nowhere did Talos mention this 'They are Happy Now!!' No, I really do not think you understand the edicts of the Talassan faith!~ []
@1035678 = ~As you wish... but no funny business.~ []
@1035679 = ~I am tired, Anomen... I wish only to sleep.~ []
@1035683 = ~Come aside, then, and let us talk in earnest. I... I spoke to you earlier of my feelings for you, <CHARNAME>. If you thought that I was being facetious, then I apologize.~ []
@1035684 = ~Still, I would have you remember that you are a servant of Talos, and his will must be demonstrated in yours. Do try harder.~ []
@1035685 = ~Nothing would make me happier than to please you... and to lay with you tonight. I have dreamt about this moment, my lady, and I believe the moment is right.~ []
@1035687 = ~Here... in this place. Let me remove my tunic and you may gaze upon my body, honed through years of exertion... and you may decide for yourself if I am worthy of you.~ []
@1035692 = ~Come with me, then, for I consider nothing I have to say or offer to be funny. If you consider me flippant, then I apologize... my yearning for you is both true and honest.~ []
@1035694 = ~I had arranged for Inspector Ardis to meet with you. He has in the past been most cooperative, especially in dealing with those that confess to certain acts.~ []
@1035695 = ~Please reconsider, <CHARNAME>. I cannot stand alone a moment longer, looking upon you without touching... come aside with me and let me speak plainly of these things.~ []
@1035697 = ~Fine... but no funny business.~ []
@1035698 = ~Forget it... I said I wasn't interested and I meant it.~ []
@1035700 = ~I do not wish to be alone, my lady... I wish to be with you! For ones such as we, the time for solitude and love comes so seldom... do not turn me aside, <CHARNAME>, I beg of you.~ []
@1035701 = ~Very well... I will go with you.~ []
@1035702 = ~Fine... but no funny business.~ []
@1035703 = ~No, Anomen... and I mean it.~ []
@1035705 = ~This is talk, my lady... this is me telling you both of my desire and my love for you... I want to enfold you with my strength and feel yours. I want to listen to your heartbeat and feel it.~ []
@1035706 = ~This is talk, my lady... this is me telling you of my desire and my love. I want to listen to your heartbeat and I want you to feel mine.~ []
@1035707 = ~I want to experience passion, <CHARNAME>, and I want to experience it with you. Please do not deny me this... I do not think I could stand it.~ []
@1035709 = ~Very well, then, Anomen... you've won me over.~ []
@1035711 = ~I shall find another, <CHARNAME>. One day, perhaps... and I hope she will be as beautiful and alluring as you.~ []
@1035714 = ~Hmmm. I have been thinking. I am still a bit bitter at being rejected by the Order, but... in many ways, I have never felt so... happy. Is that not odd?~ [ANOMEN85]
@1035724 = ~But it is not just that. Not a month ago, I never would have foreseen this. Rejected by the Order, I would have thought my life over. But the freedom... it is most intoxicating.~ []
@1035725 = ~I killed a man. It wasn't... it wasn't self-defense. Others have said it was, but I know better. He... he did issue a challenge, and we did fight, but he said such things...~ []
@1035726 = ~I need no longer restrict myself to dusty codes of conduct and goodness. No more worrying about honor... I may do as I please and live life as I wish. And I have found you.~ []
@1035728 = ~And I know that I have not done anything untoward. Helm has not been offended... he accepts my worship, still. The Order has turned me aside, but my God knows better.~ []
@1035729 = ~Things have gone well, I think. Helm has worked a mysterious trick on my destiny. We are meant to be together, you and I... I am interested to see what will come of it.~ []
@1035730 = ~I agree... we are meant to be together.~ []
@1035731 = ~I do not think you should talk so flippantly of what Helm is thinking... overconfidence can be dangerous.~ []
@1035734 = ~Don't go making plans... you may not be around to see them through.~ []
@1035736 = ~Simple. Kill all the witnesses. It was an innocent duel if no one is left to say different.~ []
@1035753 = ~Hmm. Do you suspect me of still being bitter against the Order, then, my lady? Perhaps a little, I am... but moreover I am glad to be rid of the yoke of that sad group of men.~ []
@1035756 = ~Well, I'm pleased to hear you say that, my lady. I've become quite used to your company over our time together... and I have no wish to see us part ways.~ []
@1035757 = ~I think I know what Helm approves or disapproves of better than some, my lady. He has not abandoned me... at least not yet.~ []
@1035758 = ~Deny it if you wish, my lady, 'tis destiny and there is no denying it. But... you are likely correct. Fate likely has a few surprises in store for us, yet.~ []
@1035759 = ~Aye. Death may come at any time for either of us, 'tis true. No one may know what fate has up its sleeve... but I'll make a wager on it, regardless, my lady.~ []
@1035760 = ~We are to rest, now, are we? That is good. Come, my lady... I wish to speak with you for a moment away from the ears of others.~ [ANOMEN86]
@1035761 = ~I... have something I must say to you, <CHARNAME>. I do not wish you to think me flippant or lacking in sincerity... I mean this most honestly, what I will say.~ []
@1035763 = ~My... my life is full of chaos, now, and I wish for there to be one thing that is permanent. So I offer my heart to you, along with my service and my companionship.~ []
@1035766 = ~Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of this -- the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is a descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs. The shaft is about 18 inches long. Powerful magical energy flows through this weapon, though its origins are unknown.

@1035774 = ~Yes. Yes, you tell the truth of it. It matters not, my love... I shall remain at your side until this quest of yours is completed. And... perhaps then your mind will have changed its course.~ []
@1035775 = ~Ahhhh... the truth burns my soul, to hear such words from your lips!~ []
@1035776 = ~But... better to have it said, now, than to suffer at length. Turned away from the Order and my love, both...'tis my fate, it seems.~ []

@1035785 = ~Good for you... now we need to get moving.~ []

@1035791 = ~Short Sword +2
The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term 'short sword' does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting. There are etched runes on the surface of this weapon that glow during combat, indicating it has undergone some form of enchantment, but no identifying marks can be found.

@1035888 = ~Good for you... now let's keep moving.~ []
@1035907 = ~I have also been thinking of Saerk... and I am glad that you pushed me to refrain from taking vengeance on the man. There was no real evidence of his involvement, was there?~ []
@1035908 = ~It would have been wrong of me to listen to my father's ravings. Moira... she would not have wanted me to take bloody vengeance for her, not if it wasn't true.~ []
@1035909 = ~And, if... if Saerk did those things... well. Well, he will pay for them. Someday... I suppose. The gods will see to that.~ []
@1035912 = ~Aye, perhaps now is not the best time to talk. I only wished to thank you, my lady... for pushing me towards keeping the righteous path during that business.~ []
@1035913 = ~It... it would not have been right for me to take vengeance. And I achieved my dream in the Order, after all that. Father... will just have to be satisfied with things as they are... yes.~ []

@1035917 = ~Ahhhh, it is a simple hope, is all. But not likely. Perhaps father will speak to me again when I next return to him. Moira... Moira would want me to, I think.~ []

@1035939 = ~Be quick about it. I have to report on your value as a 'servant' of the people.~ []
@1035940 = ~Well done! Death and destruction all around, a man's life ruined, and profit for the church as well. That he lives to suffer is even more fitting.~ []
@1035941 = ~Excellent! Destruction, death, and the damning of a soul to torment. Talos surely approves.~ []
@1035953 = ~I advised him to forgive his wife her transgressions. They are happy now.~ []
@1035962 = ~I have returned to evaluate your performance of your duty to Helm. What have you to tell me about Ti'Vael the dwarf? How did you advise him to deal with his problem?~ []
@1035963 = ~Katana
The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword which ends in a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation both complex and secret, and more an art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is rare. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@1036008 = ~You may think you have nothing to report to me about your advice to the dwarf Ti'Vael, but I know better. A friend in the guard has informed me that he is dead.~ []
@1036010 = ~So your benign advice put him off his guard and got him killed. I question the method, but the results please the church. In future, try to expand upon the chaos caused.~ []
@1036012 = ~You have done exceptionally well. By taking responsibility he has spared his soul a most dreadful anguish. This adherence to a higher law is very agreeable to Helm's teachings.~ []
@1036016 = ~A friend in the city guard has informed me about a sad occurrence. The dwarf you were to have given guidance has turned up dead. It would seem that he thought his crime would go unpunished.~ []
@1036019 = ~I have been speaking with some followers that belong to the guard, and they tell me that the dwarf Ti'Vael turned himself in on your advice.~ []
@1036020 = ~While the law is served in this case, I cannot help but wonder if the actual victims could not have been better provided for. Still, Ti'Vael will pay what penalty he thinks he must.~ []
@1036022 = ~When I first met you, my lady... there are many things that went through my head. The possibility that you were not what you seemed, for instance.~ []

@1036031 = ~Really, <CHARNAME>, the advice you gave him could have been a little more proactive, and could have avoided this. If he had taken responsibility... well, what is done is done.~ []

@1036041 = ~Aye, you speak the truth of it. This knight shall remain at your side, regardless, because he loves you yet... I shall protect you regardless of your desire.~ []

@1036046 = ~I... I am out of my mind. I am out of my mind with love and with passion. You occupy it completely, and to hear you scorn me so hurts... hurts me more than I can bear.~ []
@1036047 = ~That you have led me this far saddens me... I trusted you, my lady. I trusted you and I gave you my heart, and you have abused it. Was I... was I so unworthy?~ []

@1036055 = ~Aye... your father bade me to track you down wherever you might be. With good gold, as well. Here is the letter... and I shall leave you, then, my commission done.~ []
@1036059 = ~... no... no, Helm's mercy, no!~ []
@1036061 = ~My... my father writes, here: "... the authorities have found Moira's murderers... a pair of disgruntled workers who were once under my employ..."~ []
@1036062 = ~"... not finding anything of worth, they demanded valuables from your sister and killed her when she could produce nothing. The men have been caught and confessed all..."~ []

@1036079 = ~I... I am doing what I must, <CHARNAME>. I love you... and I have lost everything. You... you did what you thought right... I forgive you, my love. But... but my father...~ []
@1036080 = ~... my father and I have a reckoning that will not be stopped. Him I do not forgive, nor will I ever. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I must go to Athkatla, now...~ []
@1036081 = ~... I must go and atone for what I have done. And my father will atone with me. Fare... fare you well...~ []
@1036082 = ~Aye, but it is happening anyway. As it must, for I have lost everything. You... you I forgive, for you meant well. But my father...~ []
@1036083 = ~Aye... aye, you are right in that. You meant well, and are not responsible for my heart. I cannot blame you, my love. But... my father...~ []
@1036084 = ~Aye... you do not deserve my anger. What you did... you meant well by me, at least. I cannot blame you, my love. But... my father...~ []
@1036085 = ~This is the end, Father. Your thoughtless cruelty destroyed Mother... it destroyed Moira... and it destroyed me. I shall atone for my evil acts, and so shall you!~ [ANOMEN93]
@1036086 = ~I am no priest, my former son... you'll not see me bowing before any altars! Best be on your way before I get angry!~ [COR09]
@1036087 = ~You'll atone, father, whether you like it or not. I shall kill you... we shall die together and end this madness as it should be ended!~ []
@1036088 = ~You... you would kill me?! Bah! You're too weak to go through with such an act!~ []
@1036089 = ~It is no act. Prepare yourself, father, for I... what?! <CHARNAME>? What are you doing here?!~ []
@1036095 = ~This will take you further down the path toward evil, Anomen... do not do it.~ []
@1036096 = ~It's time for all this hate to end, Anomen... and you have to be the one to stop it!~ []
@1036102 = ~I intend to do this myself. I do not want you to dirty your hands, my love... but I will not stop whatever you intend. As I said before, then, father... prepare yourself!~ []
@1036103 = ~Very well, then. I... I had no wish for you to see this, but it matters not. I am atoning for what I have done... and father... as I said before... prepare yourself!~ []
@1036104 = ~Aye... aye, you speak the right of it. Father is not responsible solely for what I have done... it has always been I...~ []
@1036105 = ~There is an evil in my heart, I have always known this and I spoke of it to you. Hate and anger, twisted and black... and I... I cannot control it. But... nor can I live with it...~ []
@1036108 = ~Because you will be stronger, then... because we will be together.~ []
@1036110 = ~Aye. Aye, you speak the right of it. I do not wish to go down this path, no matter what my father has done to me. But... I may have no choice, my love.~ []
@1036111 = ~I... I cannot, my love. My heart overflows with rage, and it always has. I cannot live with this... and there is only one way to quench it, one way to atone. I am sorry...~ []
@1036112 = ~Aye... I love you, too. But it is already done. There is a hate in my heart, and only one way to quench it, to atone for what I have done. I... I am sorry, my love...~ []
@1036113 = ~Then... then that is enough for me. I will live on the hope that your love... will one day quench my hate. I thank you, <CHARNAME>, for... for stopping me.~ []
@1036114 = ~Bah! I always knew you were too much of a pansy to go through with it! I was right to disown you as I did... weak and pathetic, you are, since a boy, even!~ []
@1036115 = ~I could have been more, father, had you cared. I... I always loved you. And I still do.~ []
@1036117 = ~Aye. And still I do. We are so much alike, you and I. More than you will ever know. We... could have been so much more.~ []
@1036118 = ~Go, then. Go and tend to your petty schemes, I'll have no more of it. Perhaps one day, if you find some shred of enlightenment... perhaps, then, we'll speak again.~ []
@1036119 = ~... Aye... perhaps...~ []
@1036120 = ~I am sorry, my love, for all of this disturbance. You have a quest to attend to... and I intend to be there to assist you. Now... and forever more...~ []
@1036123 = ~<CHARNAME>,

Goodbye. No sappy farewells or crying over how things must be; I do neither of these things well, nor would I wish to. I have made a decision; one that is not ideal, but it is necessary. I can go nowhere without this shadow, and I wish to leave it behind. I am returning to the Harper Hold that I might face judgement there. I will plead the case as we saw it for whatever they accuse, and if they do not see reason then I will suffer what I must. Galvarey had detractors as well as allies, so I believe I can end this in my favor. If not, at least it will be an end.
 
I do not ask you to follow. I do this for myself, and there will be little or no gain for you. You may still be a target of violence, but perhaps their interest in you will wither beside the capture of a 'traitor.' 

For better or worse, I am taking control once more. I hope to see you again in better times. 

With Nature's love and mine,
Jaheira~ []
@1036124 = ~Together. Together, yes... but do you love me, <CHARNAME>? Am I only your companion, or will I have your strength to draw on?~ []
@1036126 = ~No... I do not love you in that way.~ []
@1036127 = ~Then what is done is done. I have always loved you, <CHARNAME>, but it ends here. I... I am sorry...~ []
@1036128 = ~Well, I'm not accustomed to getting such presents like this. I will have it looked into, and should a reward be appropriate, I will have it delivered to the temple.~ []
@1036131 = ~<CHARNAME>. I... I do love you, as I have said so many times. It is true. But... it is not enough. Not enough to assuage my dark soul.~ []
@1036132 = ~I cannot stay here, after what I have done. And I cannot stay with you. 
I... must go elsewhere. I am sorry... truly sorry.~ []
@1036135 = ~There... the fool is dead, and good riddance. I always knew he was weak, and now I've proved it.~ []
@1036136 = ~You, there... you are the harlot that Anomen adventured with, I see. What are your intentions, then?~ []
@1036138 = ~I will leave you, Lord Cor... but I want you to know that you destroyed a good man. I hope you can live with that.~ []
@1036168 = ~If I must. Speak, and spare no tawdry detail of your confession.~ []
@1036169 = ~I have been slaving away here for some years, and I find it a great insult that you have been promoted above me. It is inexcusable, and also quite perplexing.~ []
@1036176 = ~I demand satisfaction, and I demand it now. You have made offense, albeit indirectly, and now you will duel me, and you will die.~ []
@1036181 = ~Wakizashi
The wakizashi, or companion sword, is extremely important to samurai. It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night. As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi is a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, and is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user.

@1036269 = ~Now there is a more serious matter to attend to. There is trouble ahead for the entire temple if we do not act. I'm sure you will agree when you hear what I have to say.~ []
@1036283 = ~Tonight, <CHARNAME>, You must enter the Talos temple and... and remove the threat to the coming of dawn. Kill Weathermistress Ada. She longs for our destruction, and she has given the order. You have little time, and the odds are great. Perhaps if Ada is struck down in the middle of their temple, they will think twice before attacking us. Be careful.~ []

@1036315 = ~Among mankind's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks that had been sharpened at one end. Upon mastering the use of metals, weaponsmiths forged spear heads from iron and steel, and began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain types of polearms. Another line of tinkering led to the use of magic in spear construction. Tribal shamans would enchant a spear so that it would hit more often, and do greater damage to its wielder's opponents.

@1036338 = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons, and in an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This particular sword is even more capable of such functions, serving as a fearful reminder of what comes of the union between weaponsmithing and sorcery.

Enchantments have made this morning star lighter, faster, and far more deadly than a normal weapon of its kind.

Disaster comes on the heels of your victory in Baldur's Gate, and you are captured while resting outside the city. You know nothing of your assailant, save that you were beaten senseless with apparently minimal effort, and now you lie in a strange prison, awaiting your fate. Vague memories of torture and experimentation haunt you, leaving you battered and without hope.

@1036694 = ~<CHARNAME>, if we be parting ways, then let me give to you the deeds to the playhouse in Amn. May it be yours and may all who serve you do so gallantly...~ []
@1036700 = ~ You... you're nothing like I thought! I will have no part of you!~ [NALIA06]
@1036709 = ~ I'm afraid I'm the needy one now... help me, please.~ [NALIA15]
@1036715 = ~Yes, Miss Raelis. Ah... my ravens, there be a tale between us that is long overdue: forgive me if I led you to believe that yon gem was just a worthless bauble for the stage.~ []
@1036718 = ~As you are well aware, this playhouse in which we stand is property of the Sigil theater troupe, which is to say Miss Raelis, myself, and our company of fellow actors.~ []
@1036721 = ~Little did we know that the sordid tale of lust between two certain planar beings might hold a mirror to the truth. Within hours the theater was left in ruins and a price was placed upon our fleeing heads.~ []
@1036728 = ~Yes, Miss Raelis. Ah... my ravens, there be a tale between us that is long overdue:  Forgive me if I led you to believe that yon gem was just a worthless bauble for the stage.~ []

@1036741 = ~A crossbow is a bow mounted crosswise on a wooden or metal shaft called a tiller. The bow is usually made of ash or yew. The crossbow fires a type of projectile known as a quarrel or bolt. Light crossbows not only weigh less than their heavier counterparts, but they fire faster as well. This magical crossbow is elegant and light in the hand, firing with little recoil.

@1036749 = ~His wished you to be recognized for your heroics. You truly exemplify the paladin spirit, and I would have you demonstrate it further.~ []
@1036756 = ~It would be an honor to serve in any way that I can.~ []
@1036759 = ~Then you shall continue under the guidance of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. You could ask for no better a patron.~ []
@1036765 = ~The cause shall be just if you perform as you should. Do not neglect your own quests, but treat your assignments with urgency. Go to William Reirrac now.~ []
@1036766 = ~I am not asking you to forever forgo your own agenda, just set it aside for a short time. This offer will not be made again. Decide well and forever.~ []
@1036770 = ~I look forward to the reports of your achievements. I'm sure you will not betray our faith in your ability.~ []
@1036778 = ~It is a great shame that you did not wish to join the Order. You would have been a great asset, though I am sure you still serve the cause of righteousness.~ []
@1036779 = ~You have disgraced the Order and all that it stands for. Find your way as you will, but you will get no help from here.~ []
@1036780 = ~You have done much for the cause of good, even while mistakenly under the guise of a villain. Speak with the Prelate, for he would have the Order make amends.~ []
@1036782 = ~Your refusal is mystifying. Go with our good graces, but remember what you have lost here today.~ []
@1036784 = ~Your name is spoken well of by those that matter most. Go to the Prelate, for he has much to say.~ []
@1036787 = ~You have proven unworthy of the Order. Go and seek your fortune elsewhere, for you will find no sanctuary here.~ []
@1036788 = ~Tyr does live in your actions. Go to the Prelate, that your peers might honor you.~ []
@1036790 = ~I heard of your service to the cause of goodness, but you will not be taking orders from me on this matter. Go to the Prelate, I will speak of other things later.~ []
@1036798 = ~I hope the Order agrees with me. My beliefs are very strict.~ []
@1036810 = ~I will go this instant! Others of the Order will not fall while I stand idle!~ []
@1036812 = ~I will leave as soon as I restock and rest up.~ []
@1036816 = ~You have returned, as have our observing runners. The battle was bloody and fierce, and the outcome all but certain.~ []
@1036822 = ~Only one of our order fell once you joined the fray, though it is a sad loss. She was a squire, the future of the Order, and barely knew life's fleeting wonder.~ []
@1036826 = ~You have betrayed us with your slothfulness. Did you think me not serious when I said that time was of the essence? You are hereby expelled from the Order.~ []
@1036827 = ~Is there nothing I can do? I am sincere in my apology.~ []
@1036846 = ~But we cannot rest upon our laurels for long. There is still much for our kind to do, as the villainous do not rest while we do.~ []
@1036852 = ~Listen, you little maggot! I want to know how you got your collar off, right now... or you'll find there are far worse things than being a slave!~ []
@1036859 = ~What? Others? Ah... the primes. How foolish of you to have followed your actor friends here. Von'ith, close the portal, please.~ []
@1036865 = ~It doesn't matter... I'm here to rescue my friends.~ []
@1036868 = ~Not really... just came through for a bit of sight-seeing, really.~ []
@1036870 = ~This place is one of the finest prisons in the planes. There is no way out of here... except at the whim of the cambion. What fools you must be to come here of your own volition.~ []
@1036871 = ~I am new to the Order. My name is <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1036874 = ~No matter. I expect you'll bring a grand price from the cambion as new thralls. Hunters... take <PRO_HIMHER>!~ []
@1036875 = ~Oh, you are a sharp one, prime. I'm afraid it's much, much worse than that.~ []
@1036877 = ~Hah! Witless and full of bravado, as well. You've experience in your bearing, of that I have no doubt... but if you think your arrival will help your friends, you are quite wrong.~ []
@1036878 = ~Then you are more witless than I mistook you for. This is a poor choice for a sight-seeing trip, prime... as it will likely be your last.~ []
@1036879 = ~I am new to the Order. My name is <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1036882 = ~<CHARNAME>... I do not know it, but I am just a squire. You must have impressed the Prelate if you are a full member. I... I should go. There is much to report...~ []
@1036883 = ~Ah, of course. I am but a squire and still unsure as to how far I might take liberties talking. I will go report these horrible circumstances. Thank you again.~ []
@1036886 = ~Thank the Wounded One for saving Shamus today,  I feared his wounds too grave. Elotte however... I will weep for her. She would have made a fine knight.~ []
@1036888 = ~I must take solace in the teachings of the Maimed God, for I share his pain. Elotte and Shamus... They shall be missed by all that knew them.~ []
@1036890 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I am new to the Order. I wish I could have helped more.~ []
@1036894 = ~We must reflect on what we have done. Action without thought is mere instinct, and there is no righteousness in that. You will learn this in the Order. Go if you must.~ []
@1036896 = ~I must speak of these villainous events to the Order... to mourn the losses and exalt the successes. This is the hardest part of the journey. Fear it, young one.~ []
@1036905 = ~'Tis a case of the pot calling the kettle black, I would think. Suit yourself. I must pick up the pieces and go on, to honor the fallen.~ []
@1036906 = ~Of course you did. I always dread the walk home. The glory of the fight is more fulfilling than picking up the pieces afterwards. Farewell.~ []
@1036909 = ~I... I thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, for your timely rescue. I am afraid I did not give much thought as to what I would do after I removed my collar.~ []
@1036917 = ~The warden keeps a large number of slaves here... prisoners that have been turned into thralls by a magical collar that they wear that controls them. They are next to impossible to remove.~ []
@1036918 = ~Mine had a small flaw in it, and I was able to squirm out of it not long ago... only to find that there was almost nowhere for me to go, here, and danger down every corridor.~ []
@1036930 = ~There be no physical exit that I know of. The portals lead only to other rooms within the prison, and there are no doors or windows... if, indeed, there is even an outside to speak of, here.~ []
@1036931 = ~No... the only way one can leave is through the use of magic. Powerful magic that only a few might have, to attract a conduit to this dim and forsaken place.~ []
@1036933 = ~You mentioned a collar... what did you mean by that?~ []
@1036943 = ~Hello, father. Are you... are you coming home for a while?~ []
@1036946 = ~You are friends of the actors? Ahhh... then you may as well begin mourning them, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. They are in the warden's cells, awaiting transport to Duke Rowan's tower, I am told.~ []
@1036947 = ~The warden is directly north of here, through the hallway... but I would advise against going down that path.~ []
@1036948 = ~You will see on the floor markings that the tanar'ri have left with their magic... portals that transport you to the other rooms of this prison.~ []
@1036950 = ~There is another way to reach the warden... a safer way, perhaps, that may serve your purpose and perhaps mine, as well. Might I tell you of it?~ []
@1036954 = ~Er... if you could but tarry a moment, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I could perhaps offer you some small assistance... something that would aid me, as well.~ []
@1036959 = ~The passage to the east leads to the chambers of the Master of Thralls... a lesser tanar'ri who holds a device that I know allows him to control the collars.~ []
@1036960 = ~Destroy that device and the thralls are freed. The warden is vulnerable... and I will be able to contact my newly freed friends. Some of them are mages who will teleport us away.~ []
@1036961 = ~As well, the portals on the floors to the east may be avoided... they lead only to other cells, I understand, and are full of naught but violent and dangerous creatures.~ []
@1036962 = ~I... I would not offer this chance, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, if I did not think you might have a chance against the warden, himself. I can think of no other way for either of us to escape this place, truly.~ []
@1036965 = ~There are many old and powerful magics in this prison, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We might get away briefly, but the prison's magic would track us... and the warden would send powerful hunters very quickly.~ []
@1036968 = ~Forget it... I will try to find my own way out of here.~ []
@1036970 = ~Then... then I wish you well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I, myself, shall remain here where it is safe... for now.~ []
@1036972 = ~Then all hope is lost. I... I hope you find some way out, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I truly do.~ []
@1036977 = ~I care not for bureaucratic types, but I serve the will of the Order.~ []
@1036979 = ~Be most careful, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! I understand the Master of Thralls to be a fearsome opponent! But... but you must destroy his device! The thralls must be free!~ []
@1036980 = ~You have destroyed the orb, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I... I almost did not believe it possible! How wondrous!~ []
@1036984 = ~Is... is there something that I can do for you, my <LADYLORD>? I shall do anything I can, in return for the kindness you have paid me.~ []
@1036988 = ~The Baron waits in a neutral meeting place. He is in a tavern in the Umar Hills, in the village of Imnesvale. Go now.~ []
@1036994 = ~You mentioned a plan you had to get us out of here... tell me about it, please.~ []
@1037000 = ~I see. Well... I shall wish you luck, regardless, in escaping this place.~ []
@1037005 = ~Ah... I see you have the orb with you, my <LADYLORD>. I think the brazier in the room just east of here might serve to destroy it... if anything can.~ []
@1037012 = ~We... we... attack them! Attack them and kill them all!!~ []
@1037030 = ~Hmmmn... vermin, I see. Come, my pretty thralls. These are no escaped prisoners... these are invaders! We must destroy them for my master!~ []
@1037036 = ~You... you have killed the master! You have killed him!! By Clangeddin's Axe, I thought such a thing not even possible!~ []
@1037043 = ~Y-yes... the Warden is in the great chamber just west of here, down the hall. B-but... do you not want to destroy the orb, first?~ []
@1037048 = ~Y-yes... it is the orb he carries... the orb of mastery! I... I cannot touch it so long as I wear this collar. But if you wish to destroy it, you can...~ []
@1037049 = ~You must take the orb to the room south of here with the magical brazier in the center... the flames will surely destroy the orb and free all the thralls, here, in the process!~ []
@1037050 = ~I... I must flee before the Warden discovers that the Master of Thralls is dead! Please... destroy the orb if you are able! I beg you!!~ []
@1037051 = ~There... there is no way out! No way at all! Unless... unless you destroy the orb, I suppose. That... that would free all the thralls...~ []
@1037056 = ~The thralls could... we could remove our collars... and the Warden would be unprotected. Killing the Warden is... is the only way out, I think. I... I don't know...~ []
@1037061 = ~I cannot touch the orb so long as I wear the collar... and I cannot remove the collar without the orb's destruction...~ []
@1037066 = ~There... there is a room to the south... you can reach it through the chambers of the Warden's pet. Although... although I suppose you already came through that way...~ []
@1037067 = ~But... beyond it is a chamber with a brazier in the center. The magical flames might... might serve to destroy the orb. It is the only way I can think to do this...~ []
@1037072 = ~Y-yes... that is the only way. I wish you well... if you take on the warden...~ []
@1037073 = ~Ah... you are the pitiful group of fools from the prime material plane, I see. Well, you will disturb my prison no further. No one escapes this place... no one.~ []
@1037075 = ~Call on the Master of Thralls... I wish to know what is occurring, here. I will tear this plane apart to have those filthy slaves returned! I will flay the skin from their...~ []
@1037076 = ~... what is this? You are not my guards! It... it is you!! You are causing these problems!! I shall take the rest of eternity to make you suffer!!~ []
@1037080 = ~You... you have defeated the Warden and freed us all. I wish I had some better way to thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but I have little doubt you will find a way home on your own.~ []
@1037082 = ~Please... accept my most heart-felt thanks. The thralls who were once imprisoned here shall always remember you.~ []
@1037085 = ~I am of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, and I will support the side of right.~ []
@1037086 = ~Order! Is that what the Baron Metrich calls it? I suppose he would think so, but he wasn't here first. His order is a lot different than this place used to be.~ []
@1037089 = ~Are you now? Then maybe you'll be a voice of reason. Not like anyone has cared up until now. Brush the squatters away, even if they were here before.~ []
@1037090 = ~You want the whole story, you ask around. Go to your meeting with all sides known and make your mind up then. Do that, and maybe we'll get what we deserve.~ []
@1037093 = ~I am well worried by what has gone on in this place. Though the choice seems clear and right I am hesitant to take it.~ [ANOMENA7]
@1037105 = ~Baron Metrich took over just recently. He's been trying to run us out, preferring private hunting grounds to our farms. He's taxed, burned, and raided!~ []
@1037113 = ~It's not surprising. You are probably lying to protect yourself and I will believe no more.~ []
@1037114 = ~And, here... I have procured a key for the place from one of his servants. Take it, Anomen. Go... go and avenge our Moira. Let justice be done.~ []
@1037121 = ~Then I shall go there. The Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart would not wish I miss it.~ []
@1037126 = ~You do not love me anymore? ... I... I have always loved you and I always shall. However well I hide it, every day I spend without you is a day that's lost forever.~ []
@1037130 = ~ I am not comfortable wandering about in the dark. The shadows could hold anyone... anything.~ [NALIA20]
@1037145 = ~I will not harm you without cause. I am from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.~ []
@1037147 = ~But that is how I was in the circus when I was kept in a--a cage. It was horrible, Valygar, but Quayle came and healed me... healed my sores where...~ []
@1037151 = ~The arms and legs seem melded with the sarcophagus. You may not remove them while their guardian still lives.~ []
@1037152 = ~Psychic Drain~ []
@1037153 = ~When you touch the bones, a wave of nausea and fear washes over you. Covering your hands, you carefully place the arms and legs in your pack.~ []
@1037172 = ~Who are you? Oh, whoever you are, you must flee this place at once! He... he's killed everyone else who has come into this place, almost! Oh, please run!~ [AERIE01]
@1037177 = ~Kalah! Oh, I don't know what he's done, exactly, or how... but everything here is an illusion! But it's magic that can hurt you, if you believe in it...~ []
@1037178 = ~Oh, you probably don't understand, do you? I... I don't know what he's done to the tent or with the others who have come in, but their deaths are real! You must run!~ []
@1037184 = ~I... I'm not a monster! I'm an elf, a winged elf... or at least I was...~ []
@1037185 = ~This... this covering you see is some kind of illusion, but if you believe in it then it becomes real! P-please believe me! Now go before something happens to you, I beg of you!~ []
@1037189 = ~Perhaps you're right, then... I should go.~ []
@1037190 = ~Oh, I hope you don't end up like... like the others! But, alright... m-my name is Aerie. I... work in the circus with my uncle, Quayle...~ []
@1037191 = ~I don't know exactly what happened, but everything changed a few days ago... everything became chaos and turned into what you see here. Although it all isn't real, it's an illusion...~ []
@1037192 = ~The minions... they all say they serve Kalah, so I know he's behind all of this... he's an illusionist in the circus, but I don't understand how he was able to do all of this!~ []
@1037193 = ~He must be stopped! Before he hurts any more people! Please... if... if you release me from my chains, I can help you stop him!~ []
@1037200 = ~No! No, you don't underst... RrrrRRAARGH! I WILL KILL YOU ALL!!~ []
@1037201 = ~Yes! Go, if you can! I... I don't want to see any more people hurt!~ []
@1037202 = ~I... I come from a race of winged elves... although there aren't many of us left. From the Sundabar Mountains in the far North. My wings were cut off a long time ago, though...~ []
@1037203 = ~But... but that isn't important! This place is too dangerous! Go back to the city and warn everyone what is happening here! You must flee!~ []
@1037208 = ~The chains are invisible... covered by the illusion. And... and they are magical... they prevent me from casting my own spells and they maintain the illusion which is placed on me...~ []
@1037213 = ~You... you need the key to these chains. But... but it won't look like a key! There are a couple of... commoners... in the north side of this chamber...~ []
@1037214 = ~Don't be fooled by the illusion, though... they are monsters! They have a sword which is actually my key... if you get it from them, I can remove the chain and regain my normal form!~ []
@1037215 = ~But please be careful! You... you can't trust anything you see, here!~ []
@1037216 = ~I don't know... I tried, earlier, when this first happened. Kalah's spells are too powerful, somehow. He's... he's never been that good, though, so I don't know what he's done...~ []
@1037217 = ~If you free me, though, together we can find out and stop him! And... and hopefully rescue my Uncle, Quayle...~ []
@1037222 = ~Alright, then... but be careful! And don't trust anything that you see! And... and please save my Uncle, Quayle! Please!~ []
@1037223 = ~You... you aren't going to help anyone? But... well, if you must... if that's safest...~ []
@1037224 = ~If... if you're not going to flee, then maybe you can help free me from the chains that keep me bound in this form... and then maybe I can help you!~ [AERIED1]
@1037225 = ~I will do what is just. I am from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.~ []
@1037226 = ~Perhaps. Perhaps I am here to do the job.~ []
@1037228 = ~I don't see any chains... what are you referring to?~ []
@1037232 = ~I'm sorry, but I have no time to help you... I must confront this Kalah quickly!~ []
@1037234 = ~You... you haven't found the sword? Oh, please hurry! The... the peasants who have it are on the north side of the chamber... but they aren't what they seem!~ [AERIED2]
@1037244 = ~Have... have you found Quayle?~ [AERIEC9]
@1037247 = ~Not yet... and I would appreciate your help. Please join me and we will look together.~ []
@1037249 = ~Yes... this is it, this is the planar sphere here in the slums. We should... climb the stairs and find some manner of entrance. If I am right, my blood, my presence should open the sphere...~ [VALYGA70]
@1037251 = ~I am dying... and I wish to die there. Under my own sun.~ []
@1037252 = ~In return... in return I shall tell you how to return the sphere to our own plane. I... I am glad that you entered the sphere when you did.~ []
@1037253 = ~I was able to keep from the force... the fact that the sphere had a defense against intrusion. It would automatically travel to another plane...~ []
@1037254 = ~A trap... that would allow me to deal with the intruders... at will. But... that was another time. Bring me home, Valygar Corthala, and I will tell you how...~ []
@1037255 = ~Very well. The sphere... the sphere is powered by the heart of a powerful demon. Our last trip, now, would have depleted the power source of the last heart the sphere had...~ []
@1037257 = ~Bring the heart to the engine room of the sphere and place it inside the engine golem at the center there... and I will pre-set the controls while you are gone.~ []
@1037258 = ~But go quickly, Valygar... there are things that will stir in the planes and take notice of the sphere now that it is here! Go! And I... will try to hang on long enough...~ []
@1037259 = ~We have returned to our home plane, have we? Then I... then I shall complete Lavok's request. Excuse me, <CHARNAME>... I will go outside with my ancestor...~ []
@1037264 = ~I have had an age and more to consider my sins. If I could call it all back... if I could call back my brother and my son... my granddaughter and grandsons... I...~ []
@1037266 = ~The... the sphere has been moved. I can sense this. It was... an automatic defense against intrusion that I kept hidden from the presence...~ []
@1037269 = ~But now that the presence is gone, you need to return to your home plane. I... I shall tell you how, in return for one thing... one small thing...~ []
@1037270 = ~I have been traveling for so long... I wish to see my home one last time. When... we return to the Prime, take me outside, and let me die under the sky of the place I was born...~ []
@1037271 = ~Very good. The... the sphere is powered by the heart of a powerful demon. Or... or at least it was. You must go outside of the sphere... and get another heart.~ []
@1037272 = ~I know this will be difficult, but you defeated the presence... so I hope that you will have strength enough for this last task. Get a heart... and return...~ []
@1037274 = ~But go... go quickly. I do not know how much longer I can maintain my existence...~ []
@1037275 = ~Then... then you will be stuck here on this plane. As am I. I... I hope you will think about this, <PRO_RACE>, and think quickly. I have as little wish to die here as you do...~ []
@1037276 = ~But you are... no longer... on your home plane. Bargain with me, stranger... and I shall tell you how to return...~ []
@1037278 = ~Very well... let me hear what you wish.~ []
@1037280 = ~So... have you decided differently? Have you... seen that there is no other way home?~ [LAVOK11]
@1037284 = ~As... as you wish. But I would not wait much... longer...~ []
@1037285 = ~You must find the heart of a demon, you must!! It... it must be strong enough to power the sphere! Go, <RACE>!~ [LAVOK12]
@1037286 = ~Yes... yes! That heart will do! Go to the engine room... and place it within the golem! Go, quickly!~ [LAVOK13]
@1037287 = ~We... we are returned to our own plane. Please... please, stranger. As per our bargain... let me see my sun one last time...~ [LAVOK14]
@1037289 = ~No, I do not trust you... you may yet pull some trick!~ []
@1037290 = ~I... am most grateful. If... you could but carry me, my strength has all but fled... my last moments... are upon me...~ [LAVOK15]
@1037291 = ~Aye... it is nothing less than I expected. I deserve nothing more, I suppose, after all my evil...~ [LAVOK16]
@1037292 = ~... I... I wish I had... had... ah...~ []
@1037293 = ~... I... I sense within you... a kindred power. You... you are a mage, yes?~ []
@1037294 = ~Yes... I see that you are. I... I grant you the sphere, mage. Do... do with it far... far better than I ever did. It is yours... to use wisely...~ []
@1037297 = ~Why not? We can't leave th' farm to rot completely... we have t' eat, aye, me <LADYLORD>?~ []
@1037302 = ~Er... talk to Erlin if you wish t' discuss the chickens, me <LADYLORD>. I'll have nothin' t' do with it.~ []
@1037308 = ~I know your secret, old man... give me the chicken or there's going to be trouble.~ []
@1037314 = ~I'm only interested in one chicken, truly... a chicken that swallowed something quite valuable...~ []
@1037317 = ~I... you're a terrible, evil <MANWOMAN>, you are! 'Tis all I have left of my daughter! All we have in the world, dead! Dead!~ []

@1037330 = ~100 gold pieces... more than fair, I am sure.~ []
@1037331 = ~Forget it... I've changed my mind.~ []

@1037337 = ~Aye... aye, 'tis more than fair. This will pay for a fine headstone for our daughter an' more. A better tribute than a hidden gem in a chicken. Take it, then... you've been more an' kind.~ []
@1037340 = ~My daughter, she is gone! She was home when I left and now she is gone! There is debris about my home and this note was there... and there is blood!~ []
@1037341 = ~My son, he is gone! He was there when I left, but now... This note was at the scene and there is debris about my home and... and there is blood!~ []

@1037353 = ~I delight so at the sparrows twittering above and look... there passes a prancing squirrel, all delighted by the softness of our approach!~ []
@1037354 = ~That fortune... brought us no end of grief, however. My family eventually took up his past-time, as well, to my sorrow.~ []

@1037360 = ~You're a dreamer, bard. I'm sure you can imagine lots of wonderful scenes... but they would not exceed the truth in intensity, depravity or tenure, I assure you.~ []
@1037372 = ~Yes you do. You should follow in here. It is safe. The orcs let us be safe in there. You should come in.~ []
@1037382 = ~Gosh... you're an adventurer, aren't you? Hey, Derbert... this <MANWOMAN>'s an adventurer! Wow!!~ []
@1037394 = ~You have met my father, <CHARNAME>... surely you have some inkling, from his manner alone if nothing else.~ []
@1037400 = ~You needn't be so impudent, child. The woman is pleasing to the eye and doth stir the loins and I was merely complimenting upon her comeliness.~ []
@1037404 = ~Ho, Haer'Dalis, your poetry ennobles me far beyond my worth. I am a simple man and by simple decisions, I have made my way about this earth.~ []

@1037436 = ~More! I would know more of this place! Tell me what defenses Lord Jierdan has!~ []
@1037437 = ~Defenses? Lord Firkraag no need defenses. You silly to think so. We hunt the feed and guard the home, but he not need us protect him.~ []

@1037541 = ~I'm sorry for what happened before... will you join me again, Haer'Dalis?~ []
@1037544 = ~Aye... the raven and the sparrow, together! It will be good to voyage with you, <CHARNAME>!~ []
@1037545 = ~Aye, but 'tis always such. Nay, I have other things more pleasant than traveling with one such as yourself. Find another, my raven.~ []
@1037546 = ~Mmmm... very well, <CHARNAME>. Let in not be said that this actor has no heart. I can forgive... and besides, it is exciting to voyage with you. Let us go, then, my raven!~ []
@1037547 = ~Aye, and greetings to you, too. I have business to attend to, however... and I suspect so do you. 'Til we meet again, my raven.~ []
@1037550 = ~So... the rescuers of our beloved Haer'Dalis have come to us, at last. Haer'Dalis has preceded you and spoken of you well. Here is a reward for his return.~ [RAELIS13]

@1037553 = ~Perhaps... how much is the stone worth to you?~ []
@1037558 = ~Yes, well, regrets to be dealt with another day. You say you have come to take delivery of something?~ []
@1037570 = ~We... we still do not have it, Miss Raelis, try though I might to convince my raven of its import. I shall endeavour to speed the process, if you will it.~ []

@1037592 = ~I am only Lanka's assistant. If you wish something, best you speak to her or the Baron directly.~ []
@1037603 = ~Yes, it is a simple matter now that you are here. I require some squatters removed from my lands. They will respect the word of the Order and go.~ []
@1037606 = ~The Order was insistent that I support you, and that is what I intend to do, whatever the details.~ []
@1037607 = ~I have a small problem. One of the farmers claimed the land was theirs, not yours.~ []
@1037610 = ~You would not wish to disappoint a potential friend of the Order, would you? These louts have assaulted my men. Deal with them in the proper fashion.~ []
@1037614 = ~Ahh, but you have proven reasonable yourself in responding to my concerns. I am content to aid you in this.~ []
@1037619 = ~You have spoken with everyone that you need to.  I would have you state your intent with no more delays!~ []
@1037624 = ~I will have my men continue without your aid. Your authority could have made the expulsion more diplomatic, but my men will do what they must. Leave here!~ []
@1037625 = ~I'm sure that, as we speak, the nobles argue over the relative benefits of white and red Evermeet wine, merely a thousand gold pieces per glass.~ [NALIA52]
@1037634 = ~Of course you will. Since you have declared it here, the farmers will not oppose a member of the Order as they have opposed me.~ []
@1037635 = ~Lanka? Have they assembled outside? I was told they might.~ []
@1037636 = ~It would appear so, though they are more armed for battle than debate.~ []
@1037638 = ~Your help has been appreciated, but I no longer have cause to speak with you. Lanka and I must set about building my regulated hunting range.~ []
@1037640 = ~Stop your feeding, my spiders! New victims await! Protect your home!~ []
@1037641 = ~But why do we need to continue this discussion? You have already begun cleansing the area. One dead? Two? No matter. It will put fear into them.~ []
@1037642 = ~Regardless, you have earned my gratitude. With this simple, brutal act you have solved my problem. Go now, and tell your masters that I am pleased.~ []
@1037643 = ~It was a regrettable thing, but I had a duty to fulfill.~ []
@1037644 = ~I had little choice in the matter, though I will take pleasure in a job well done.~ []
@1037646 = ~Do not quibble over details. All is well.~ []
@1037649 = ~Moreno... no. Would you have us fight agents of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart? Matrich's men are one thing, but knights of the Order? No.~ []
@1037650 = ~It is over, Moreno, just as the Baron hoped it would be. We cannot fight such a group as the Order. The word of law has been passed here, and we are on the losing side.~ []
@1037652 = ~We'll fight you! Here and now if we have to!~ []
@1037657 = ~Lanka? Is this true?~ []
@1037659 = ~What would be your concern? Your hands are far from clean in this matter, my dear. Your precious animals and environment have made you a turncoat.~ []
@1037660 = ~The state of the land is important, but I did not agree to this.~ []
@1037662 = ~This is not open for discussion! What matters is the land I want and the people that must get off it!~ []
@1037665 = ~You are not here to think! Leave the thinking to your betters!~ []
@1037669 = ~Now just calm down and we'll straighten this all out.~ []
@1037672 = ~Well, the side you have chosen to support is now quite obvious, I think. I would have preferred a peaceful solution, but if this is the way it must be, I do appreciate being on the winning side.~ []
@1037675 = ~Regardless, this matter is resolved. We will try to bring our lives back to some semblance of normality. We will also try to resolve what guilt we feel for what we did during this incident.~ []
@1037682 = ~You have returned, though not quite as I expected. I must say that your visit to the Metrich Barony has yielded some surprising results.~ []
@1037696 = ~There was evidence of that, but my duty was to the task I was sent to achieve.~ []
@1037698 = ~I... knew of no such evidence. The squatters were quite clearly belligerent.~ []
@1037709 = ~There was evidence of that, but my duty was to the task I was sent to achieve.~ []
@1037710 = ~I... knew of no such evidence. The squatters were quite clearly belligerent.~ []
@1037722 = ~Such a crime is unforgivable! I will lead an army down the throats of those responsible!~ []
@1037730 = ~You will go to a safe-house we have set up, and you will make sure she remains secure. It is as secret as we could make it, though nothing is ever absolute.~ []
@1037738 = ~It... it is true, I can sense it! Oh, by the mercy of the Gods... you must use the artifact to destroy the beholder! You must!~ []
@1037741 = ~You... must retrieve the second half of the rod. It was split apart long ago, by the gods... in order to keep the world safe from its power.~ []
@1037742 = ~I will tell you how to gain the second half... if you agree to use it to destroy the beholder. The device cannot be taken from here, lest its curse strike you down.~ []
@1037745 = ~You... you have killed the creature who has enslaved so many. Of that, I am thankful. But... I see you still hold the rod... the rift device... yet unused.~ [SASSAR09]
@1037746 = ~Be warned, my <LADYLORD>... the device cannot be taken above the ground. My findings here have taught me that. It will surely destroy you if you do...~ []
@1037748 = ~You have destroyed the creature who has enslaved so many... and for that, I am more grateful than I can say.~ [SASSAR10]
@1037749 = ~I sense you have the rift device... the rod. You have used it? I must caution you not to take it to the lands above... its power would consume you.~ []
@1037751 = ~You have freed our brother! For that, I would lay roses at thy feet, my <LADYLORD>! But... there is still the matter of the... ah... gem, is there not?~ []
@1037752 = ~I thank you, my <LADYLORD>... you have done much for us all.~ []
@1037755 = ~Our poor sparrow lies broken. All is darkness, now, for us all... regardless of what occurs...~ []
@1037756 = ~Ahhh... our brother is dead. Poor Haer'Dalis, truly he had little in the way of luck. Leave us be, Prime... we must mourn for our fallen comrade...~ []
@1037757 = ~He... he's free, is he? That's good... Raelis says I still have a long time before I am ready to be a full actor. But I don't mind... it's my dream and I'll work hard!~ []
@1037758 = ~Raelis has asked me to come along and join the troupe! Imagine that... me, a Prime, traveling the planes! And acting! Truly acting!!~ []
@1037759 = ~Haer'Dalis is dead... that means... that means I have to continue acting. Ooooh, I feel ill...~ []
@1037761 = ~There's a tanner, Rejiek Hidesman, who has his shop near here... he might have some tannin, I'm not sure. Might be worth it to ask him.~ []
@1037763 = ~Halt! This place is under the protection of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. You will leave immediately or suffer the consequences!~ []
@1037768 = ~Halt! You will go no further while I am... Oh, forgive my outburst, <CHARNAME>. I was told you were coming to relieve me but I have been getting rather edgy. It has been a long day.~ []
@1037772 = ~I have... planned this for... too long only to have my plans shattered by some inbred, northern adventurers! I... I just wanted to be respected...~ [KALAH12]
@1037777 = ~This... this is Aegisfield, all right. (sigh)  It is too bad... he was a fine and just man. Here... give his body to me.~ []
@1037778 = ~Your story seems odd... but I can tell if someone's lying. I will check your story... but for now you have the city's thanks for the service you have done us.~ []

@1037829 = ~Greetings to you, my <LADYLORD>. I am afraid that I am waiting for another at the moment... perhaps some other time?~ []
@1037832 = ~Because of you, we have lost the greatest social coup this city has yet seen! Sir Sarles is gone before we could show him off! Get out of here!~ []
@1037834 = ~You have my apologies. I tried to please him, but to no avail.~ []
@1037839 = ~And I curse you for trying! How could guttertrash such as yourself hope to please a man of his caliber? Get out, and leave me be!~ []
@1037840 = ~Here... I'll mark the location on your map. We should head there immediately. Be careful not to be spotted. I hope everything is all right!~ []
@1037841 = ~Well... I've been thinking, and I'm pretty sure they would have left someone alive. Daleson... he would be tending the stable. You should try to reach him.~ []

@1037862 = ~Aye, then... I shall go. But the gem I mentioned still needs taking from Mekrath's lair. I shall await your arrival at the playhouse beneath the Five Flagons Inn... bring the gem there, I beg of you.~ [HAERDA94]
@1037868 = ~I have heard of your activities. Your disservice to the faithful means I must tell you that any task we may have asked of you is now null and void.~ []

@1037974 = ~I wouldn'a believed it if I hadn't seen it myself... that ogre's lived up to his word and saved us all from the initial attack. It's up t' you, though, now... ye has to go to the cave near here and save him.~ []
@1037975 = ~I can't believe it... that ogre an' his creatures... they went an' protected us from those ogrons come from th' hills. But now they're in trouble... you plannin' on helpin' him out o' this trouble?~ []
@1037976 = ~Ogrons have come down from th' hills an' are plannin' to attack us... you must help the village, ranger! Go, quickly!~ []
@1037977 = ~There are a group of those... those creatures preparing to attack the village! The herders say they are near the caves! Oh, you must help us, please!!~ []
@1037981 = ~Maybe ye all should just go... an' take yer former ranger friend, there, with ye. Our village... we'll find our way just fine without the likes o' <PRO_HIMHER>.~ []
@1037982 = ~Yer doin' a fine job, there, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... Merella would o' been proud, in fact. Is there anythin' yer needin' help with?~ []
@1037992 = ~You know quite a bit about the area's history, Nelleck... what can you tell me about it?~ []
@1037994 = ~Not much, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... that noble came an' didn't even talk to the Minister. Just marched on over there with 'is men, easy as ye please.~ []
@1037995 = ~There was lots o' relics and such left from th' days when mithril was mined in th' hills... but most of it's long gone. I don't think he'll find none.~ []
@1037996 = ~'At don't mean he won't disturb the forest, or burn it down while he's goin' about 'is business. Tsk... a real shame. Me pa said that area's all holy ground.~ []
@1037997 = ~None. Like I've said before... Madulf an 'em are pretty quiet an' keep t' themselves, mostly. I don't think they wants any trouble.~ []
@1037998 = ~Better than ye'd think, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Madulf and a couple o' others have been in an' out a few times... buyin' food an' usin' the inn.~ []
@1037999 = ~Folks were scared at first, but they've been real polite. Keepin' a low profile, too... as low as 'em big 'uns can get, anyway. The merchants like it, anyhow.~ []
@1038000 = ~Nay. They're long gone... an' good riddance. Got what they came for, didn't they? Heh...~ []
@1038001 = ~Nay... no one's come. Nasty bugger wasn't liked much even by them other nobles, I guess. The sacred ground will stay as it is, more or less undisturbed.~ []
@1038002 = ~Aye. Even Johanna went an' thanked Madulf, personally. And now Imnesvale's got defenders like no one else. Who'd 'ave thought, aye, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?~ []
@1038005 = ~Aye. No one expected Madulf and his followers t' actually help anyone. They been by t' trade things, an' such... real polite. People are mighty thankful.~ []
@1038006 = ~Nay, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. No sightings. Been a long time since them orcs attacked... an' I think they'll think twice, now, 'fore they try it again.~ []
@1038009 = ~Aye, things have been going very well an' smoothly, like. We're all mighty grateful to have ye here, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger.~ []
@1038011 = ~Well... the village has been here for centuries, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Even during Umar's rule... although it was a darker place, then, an' mostly just farms an' such.~ []
@1038012 = ~There was a rush a few centuries back... found mithril in th' hills. Temples and such were built all o'er the place, then abandoned when the mines ran dry.~ []
@1038016 = ~As ye wish, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... anythin' ye wish, I'll always be glad t' help ye.~ []
@1038017 = ~Despite all ye've done fer us, yer no longer welcome here, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Yer type... well, maybe ye'd better just be on yer way.~ []
@1038018 = ~There's ogrons come from the hills, my <LADYLORD>... orcs with ogre blood in 'em. They're gathered near the cave north o' the river, plannin' to attack the village.~ []
@1038023 = ~There's ogrons come from th' hills, my <LADYLORD>... orcs mixed with ogre blood. That ogre, Madulf, an' his followers... they've been fightin' them for the village.~ []
@1038026 = ~Madulf's given us some time, but the ogrons have him holed up in the cave north o' the river. He needs help... talk to the Minister, if ye haven't already.~ []
@1038030 = ~There's ogrons come from th' hills, my <LADYLORD> ranger... orcs mixed with ogre blood. Madulf an' his followers, they've kept their word and fought against 'em.~ []
@1038031 = ~They've bought us some time... but the ogrons cornered 'em in a cave north o' the river. They need help. Best go an' see the Minister, if ye haven't already.~ []
@1038033 = ~My <LADYLORD>! The... the witch, Umar, has returned an' warns us all to leave 'fore she murders us all! I can hardly believe it t' be true!~ []
@1038034 = ~The Minister has asked for ye... go an' speak to him, if ye haven't already. He knows where the witch to be... ye must protect us, my <LADYLORD>!~ []
@1038045 = ~Ahhh... good day to you, then. Is there something that you need?~ []
@1038056 = ~(sigh)  Well... ye are the local ranger, here. Very well, I'll keep me brusqueness to meself, if it offends ye. Now... did ye want t' buy somethin' or nay?~ []
@1038059 = ~As ye wish, then. But you'll get no discount, here... I nay be givin' me shelves o' goods away.~ []
@1038064 = ~Is there... is there something that you need?~ []
@1038078 = ~Actually... this is a matter I really must talk to our <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger about, my <LADYLORD>. No offense...~ []
@1038079 = ~Actually... the matter of the ogrons is something I really must talk to our <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger about, my <LADYLORD>. No offense...~ []
@1038099 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... I trust you have already been approached by the forest spirit? I am afraid there is little that I can do.~ []
@1038106 = ~That is good... I am very relieved. Lord Igen is currently in the same area as those... that Shadow Lord was, earlier. I suggest you go quickly.~ []
@1038107 = ~That is... a little more than I expected, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. But, I suppose you are correct... Lord Igen must be stopped, no matter what occurs.~ []
@1038109 = ~Go swiftly, then, and be safe... Lord Igen is in the land that the Shadow Lord was, until recently... to the west.~ []
@1038112 = ~Very well... I will keep my word. This time.~ []
@1038113 = ~Of course you are right, Minister... please forgive me.~ []
@1038114 = ~As... as you say, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The Lord Igen is in the lands to the west of here... in the area once occupied by that Shadow Lord. Be... be careful.~ []
@1038115 = ~Then... then you are unworthy to be the ranger of our village! By Mielikki, I've never seen a ranger of your sort! How you are not Fallen is beyond me!~ []
@1038123 = ~The ogron band is collected outside of the cave... on the north shore of the river. I beg of you, <CHARNAME>... please deal with this menace!~ []
@1038124 = ~... he is trapped in a cave with one of our shepherd boys, Atta, who wandered into the area. Madulf scooped the boy up and took refuge in the cave.~ []
@1038125 = ~The boy must be saved, <CHARNAME>... and Madulf must not die in vain! Please... deal with this menace, I beg you! Or we will all be forced to flee our village!~ []
@1038126 = ~... the fighting has driven him back into a cave. Rescue him, <CHARNAME>, and deal with this menace... or the whole village must flee for our lives!~ []
@1038127 = ~Yes he is, but this is too convenient for my tastes. Something could be wrong.~ []
@1038128 = ~I have no desire to fight ogrons... deal with this yourselves.~ []
@1038129 = ~Very well, Minister... I will do what I can.~ []
@1038130 = ~No, I killed the bastard. This was too easy, so I figured he was lying.~ []
@1038131 = ~But... but, <CHARNAME>! You are our ranger! You... you must help us out, we are in desperate need!~ []
@1038134 = ~Very well... I'll see what I can do.~ []

@1038138 = ~The village would be grateful, <CHARNAME>... go, then... the cave is on the north shore of the river. I... I do not know how many ogrons there are... good luck.~ []
@1038140 = ~I am most relieved! Go, <CHARNAME>... the cave is on the north shore of the river! I do not know how many ogrons there are, but I wish you well.~ []
@1038144 = ~Very well, Minister... I will help, if I can.~ []
@1038145 = ~But... but <CHARNAME>, there is a boy whose life is in danger! And you are a ranger, are you not? How can you abandon us like this?~ []
@1038147 = ~(sigh)  Very well, then... I'll see what I can do.~ []
@1038149 = ~I... I do not believe he can, <CHARNAME>. Please... a boy is in danger, and the ogre must not die for helping us. You are a ranger... will you not aid us?~ []
@1038154 = ~Very well... I will help, if I can.~ []
@1038155 = ~But the ogre is in danger, <CHARNAME>... and he fought valiantly to aid us! You... you are a ranger? Have you less honor than an ogre? Will you not help us?~ []
@1038160 = ~Very well, Minister... I will see what I can do.~ []
@1038161 = ~Of course you are right, Minister... I apologize. I will help, if I can.~ []
@1038166 = ~The cave is on the north side of the river, <CHARNAME>, not far to the northwest of here... you will find the ogrons there. Go quickly!~ []
@1038173 = ~<CHARNAME>, we are in dire straits. Umar, or someone claiming to be her, has returned. She came several days ago, ordering all the villagers to leave at once.~ []
@1038175 = ~What? That was your solution? You had better hope you are right, because if you aren't, you are going to be in sooo much trouble.~ []
@1038176 = ~Everyone was so frightened... this Umar then shouted with a great, booming voice, saying she was reclaiming her land and that we were trespassers...~ []
@1038177 = ~She has given us only a few days, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. A few days to leave forever, or she will kill us. You... you will help us, yes?~ []
@1038182 = ~(sigh)  I wonder how long I'll have to live like this? Well... all the assassins are dead, now, no matter what you've done. I know how they work. You should probably go back to the Order and report this... I'd rather be alone.~ []
@1038183 = ~I'll do what I can... where can this supposed 'Umar' be found?~ []
@1038184 = ~But you are a ranger, <CHARNAME>... you are our protector. How can you abandon us now? We cannot fight a force such as this!~ []
@1038188 = ~A... a reward? Did you become a ranger to become rich, <CHARNAME>? You have a duty! Will abandon us now, and leave us to face this witch?~ []
@1038190 = ~I suppose you're right... I'll see what I can do. Where is this 'Umar'?~ []
@1038191 = ~Of course not... I'm sorry, Minister. Where can I find this sorceress?~ []
@1038192 = ~Shepherds followed her to the lands in the west. She... went into the dungeon where you found the Shadow Lord. That is where you should start.~ []
@1038193 = ~I am grateful for your aid, <CHARNAME>... I trust the gods will look out for you... and Imnesvale... once again.~ []
@1038194 = ~Sure, sure. My father was certain, too, that his enemies wouldn't stoop to this. Well, whatever. I know how these assassins work... they're not coming back. Go back to the Order and report whatever you have to. I will be fine.~ []
@1038199 = ~Are you certain you have no proof of your identity?~ []
@1038203 = ~Are you certain you have no proof of your identity?~ []
@1038215 = ~I will go and get her directly. Forgive my obstinate nature, but I had to be sure.~ []
@1038218 = ~I will go and get her directly. Forgive my obstinate nature, but I had to be sure.~ []
@1038223 = ~You, there... you are the <PRO_RACE> who has become the ranger for this place? My name is Mairyn... I am a spirit of this forest, and I am in desperate need of your aid!~ []
@1038225 = ~There are... other humans... in my sacred lands to the north of this place where the temple of the sun god once stood. They have come recently,  digging and tearing down the trees...~ []
@1038226 = ~I have begged them to stop, good ranger... I have pleaded with them that they are destroying not only I, but many of the other forest spirits as well. The humans have refused.~ []
@1038227 = ~I implore you... go to the forest in the north and do whatever you can to stop these humans from further desecrating my forest!~ []
@1038230 = ~And we are baffled as to how you could have made such a mistake! You have killed one of the most respected servants of Torm in the realms!~ []
@1038235 = ~What has happened. <CHARNAME>? I am told that the child is dead and that an imposter of Hurgis Baltezan was also found killed.~ []
@1038239 = ~Very well, Mairyn... I will do what I can to help.~ []
@1038242 = ~No interest? You are a ranger, are you not? You are a defender of the wild... and I am in desperate need of your assistance. Will you turn your back on me, ranger?~ []
@1038244 = ~You are right... I will help you, if I can.~ []
@1038246 = ~I know not who these humans are... they claim, however, to be searching for something. Something I do not know the location of. They... threatened me, ranger. I was forced to flee.~ []
@1038250 = ~Very well... I will go and help you, if I can.~ []
@1038251 = ~Reward? You are the first ranger I have heard of who has desired something in compensation for his duty. I... I have nothing to offer you, ranger, other than my gratitude.~ []
@1038253 = ~Very well... I will see what I can do.~ []
@1038256 = ~I will tell them of their mistake... and I will deal with the humans in the west as best I can. Go, unworthy ranger... go and be a simple warrior or mercenary, if you must. The forest needs not one such as you.~ []
@1038258 = ~I... I sense that the humans yet continue their desecration of my sacred forest. What is it, good ranger? Is there a problem?~ []
@1038260 = ~I have agreed to find what the noble, Lord Igen, was looking for... but I cannot seem to find it.~ []
@1038261 = ~There is no problem, Mairyn... I will continue trying.~ []
@1038262 = ~Yes, there is. I cannot make the Lord stop his search... I can do nothing more to help you.~ []
@1038263 = ~Yes, there is. I have changed my mind... I do not have the time to help you.~ []
@1038268 = ~But how is this possible? You said he would arrive!~ []
@1038275 = ~But you must find a way to stop him, ranger... you must! He cannot continue his actions! He gives no thought to the consequence of what he does!~ []
@1038277 = ~I will not harm him, Mairyn... and I cannot help you.~ []
@1038278 = ~Very well... I will keep on trying.~ []
@1038280 = ~He seeks a cache of mithril hidden by an ancestor... but he has only half of the directions to where it lays.~ []
@1038281 = ~I do not know where this human might find this mithril. I truly do not. I might suggest that you look to the human temple beneath the ground... the place where you, yourself, banished the shadows.~ []
@1038284 = ~Perhaps you might find what you seek there... I cannot say, for certain.~ []
@1038285 = ~Mielikki bless you, good ranger... I will continue to wait here.~ []
@1038288 = ~Very well... I will try again.~ []
@1038291 = ~I already sense that the violation of my forest has ceased, good ranger. I... I am sorry that it had to come to violence. You have protected your charge, nevertheless, and I am grateful.~ []
@1038292 = ~I will return to my home, now, and thank Mielikki that one who is true to her service has taken up a station here... that justice is upheld in this woodland. Bless you, good ranger.~ []
@1038294 = ~You successfully detected the evil they were trying to perpetrate, and for that you have earned the respect of your peers and the community.~ []
@1038299 = ~Good ranger... it is I, Mairyn, and once again I must ask you for help. The witch who has threatened your village... her dark and foul magics have also begun to poison the woodland! You must do something!~ []
@1038305 = ~Very well... I will seek her out and stop her.~ []
@1038309 = ~Yes, I already know of her... I will do what I can, Mairyn.~ []
@1038316 = ~You do not know? A witch has come into the area very recently... a human witch... and she has threatened your village with her magic. Either they leave... or she will kill them.~ []
@1038317 = ~Already she gathers her dark powers in the buried human temple... that place where you destroyed the Shadow Lord. Her magic seeps into the earth and poisons it with evil.~ []
@1038323 = ~Yes, as I said... I have more important things to do.~ []
@1038324 = ~Very well... I will see what I can do. But I must go to Imnesvale, first.~ []
@1038327 = ~She lies below, good ranger, and the need is most urgent... but if you must go to your village, first, then do so quickly. I will wait here for you.~ []
@1038329 = ~I sense that the sorceress is dead... the foul presences she has conjured have ceased. You have done well, good ranger.~ []
@1038330 = ~You have served the natural order with honor and strength, good ranger. I... I have something to give you. It is a present from Mielikki, a most rare thing...~ []
@1038331 = ~... an idol of the Moon Dog to help when you struggle. Take it, <PRO_RACE>, and be thankful that a goddess smiles upon you.~ []
@1038332 = ~Oh! There you are, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger! I... I've been looking all over the place for you! You... you've got to come to Imnesvale!~ []
@1038335 = ~There's orcs... big ones! Nelleck says he saw them coming down from the hills. Soon they'll attack! The Minister sent me to find you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!~ []
@1038338 = ~Tell them to find someone else to deal with it... it's not my problem.~ []
@1038339 = ~But... but you're a ranger! You're the protector that replaced Merella, aren't you? You've got to come! We've got nobody else to turn to!~ []
@1038340 = ~Oh, please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! Please! Everyone's so scared that they're going to have to flee the village! I... I thought rangers were supposed to help people...~ []
@1038341 = ~Madulf... he said he would do what he can, but Nelleck says there's too many! Oh, please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! Please! I... I thought rangers were supposed to help people...~ []
@1038342 = ~Nelleck says that they'll be at the village soon... no later than three or four days from now. You've got to hurry!~ []
@1038352 = ~What... what could be more important than this?! Oooh... Nelleck says that the orcs will be on us within four days at the most... maybe less...~ []
@1038353 = ~... I... I'll go an' tell Minister Lloyd that you may not be coming. I do so hope you change your mind, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! I was sure you would help us...~ []
@1038354 = ~If you... if you change your mind... please hurry...~ []
@1038355 = ~I... I thought rangers were good people... that they protected people. I... I can't believe you won't help us anymore...~ []
@1038356 = ~Orcs... big ones... are comin' down from the hills. Nelleck saw 'em, and the Minister sent me to find you. They'll be at the village in four days... maybe less!~ []
@1038357 = ~Madulf says he'll help, but Nelleck says there's too many... even for him and those other creatures of his. The Minister says you should come quickly, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~ []
@1038358 = ~We haven't got anyone t' turn to, except you. And... and you replaced Merella, right? You'll come, then, right?~ []
@1038359 = ~I... I've found you again, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! It's... it's always so hard to find you, sometimes! The... the village is in danger again! The Minister has asked for you!~ []
@1038363 = ~It's Umar! The witch! She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now! The... the Minister says he will tell you everything!~ []
@1038367 = ~Don't have time? But... but you helped us fight those orcs... and you saved us all before that. Why... why would you abandon us now? I thought you were a ranger...~ []
@1038369 = ~Perhaps you are right... what is happening in the village?~ []
@1038371 = ~I... I can't believe you won't help us. If you... if you change your mind, please come and help! I don't think we can fight this...~ []
@1038372 = ~It's Umar! The witch! She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now! The... the Minister says he will tell you everything!~ []
@1038380 = ~Well, what you're doing is destroying the forest... you have to stop.~ []
@1038393 = ~Very well, then... off you go, peasant.~ []
@1038402 = ~I am warning you... your life is forfeit if you continue this desecration.~ []
@1038408 = ~You're not going to continue what you're doing... I'm here to see to that.~ []
@1038412 = ~Hmmmn. I might, at that. It would certainly save me a great deal of trouble... and spare me the danger of facing the monsters, here. Are you serious about this, woods<PRO_MANWOMAN>?~ []
@1038415 = ~No... I doubt you would keep your deal, anyway. It would be far better to kill you now.~ []
@1038417 = ~I am willing to put off the search... at least for a while, to give you time to look for it. I'm sure my men will be glad of the break, at any rate... and it really costs me nothing.~ []
@1038418 = ~You are a ranger, aren't you? I should have guessed from the attitude and the clothing. Very well, then, ranger. I will leave here forever, if you find what I am looking for. You have my word.~ []
@1038421 = ~He was not alone, back then. Many nobles came... and there was not enough for all, certainly. I had always assumed that Idras had found nothing, but his journal suggests otherwise.~ []
@1038423 = ~The part of the journal I have only mentions this area in general... nothing specific. Hence the large search I have undertaken. Here... I have a copy that was printed out. You may need it.~ []
@1038424 = ~The other half of his journal may be around here... I certainly couldn't say where it might be, though, and I'm not about to waste effort looking for it.~ []
@1038425 = ~So... there you have it, ranger. My men will set up camp, here, and we will give you some time to search. It means little to me, but for your sake I wish you well.~ []
@1038430 = ~... I see. So this medallion is the sum of all he found? The fool!   Ahhh, then this whole expedition has been a waste. It cannot be that valuable that all this effort has been worth it.~ []
@1038434 = ~Very well... a thousand gold and your departure is enough for me.~ []
@1038436 = ~I would prefer to hang onto it, actually... it might be worth more than you say.~ []
@1038439 = ~I suppose I do not need your coin... it is yours by right, as you say. Take it and leave, then.~ []
@1038440 = ~Sorry... two thousand or you don't get it.~ []
@1038441 = ~Do not test my patience, peasant. It is mine by right, and I will not be trifled with. I will give you five hundred gold... and do not presume to bargain with me further.~ []
@1038443 = ~Perhaps you are right. Five hundred it is... so long as you leave, as well.~ []
@1038445 = ~Aye. I am a man of my word, ranger. I have found what I desired... such as it is... and I shall go. Come, men... we are returning to the city.~ []
@1038446 = ~You are generous, then. I see the rangers are as noble as their reputation. Very well, then... I am also a man of my word. Come, men... we return to the city.~ []
@1038447 = ~I warn you, peasant. That is my property... and I shall use force, if necessary, to take it from you. I offer five hundred gold... accept or face the consequences.~ []
@1038449 = ~I've no desire for trouble... five hundred it is.~ []
@1038450 = ~Never mind, Lord Igen... I've no need for your coin. It's yours, as you said. Take it and go.~ []
@1038453 = ~Hmmmn... a commoner <MANWOMAN>. Away with you... I doubt we have any business, the two of us.~ []
@1038458 = ~That's too bad... you will not continue this desecration so long as I am here.~ []
@1038460 = ~Nothing... I'll be on my way.~ []
@1038466 = ~I found this medallion, along with a note from Idras. Apparently, he didn't have much luck... he used all his mithril to make this.~ []
@1038467 = ~I haven't... but I have found the other half of Idras' journal, here. Will you accept that, instead?~ []
@1038469 = ~No... and I have decided not to continue looking.~ []
@1038470 = ~It doesn't matter... I doubt you can be trusted, anyway. It is better to kill you now.~ []
@1038471 = ~Certainly not. I do not know where you got those writings, ranger... they might not even be authentic. And even if they are... use them to find the cache yourself.~ []
@1038473 = ~After all... it is you who is so concerned about my men leaving tracks in your precious landscape, not I.~ []

@1038567 = ~Cloak of Fear (Conjuration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Charm
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Self
Saving Throw: Neg.

Cloak of fear empowers the caster to radiate a personal aura of fear out to a 3-foot radius. All other characters and creatures within this aura must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or run away in panic for 4 rounds. Affected individuals may even drop items. Party members are immune to the effects, although the aura of fear may still disturb them.~
@1038570 = ~False Dawn (Evocation)
Level: 6
Sphere: Sun
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

False dawn calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, within the area of effect. All undead creatures within a false dawn suffer 6d6 points of damage. There is no saving throw against this damage. Affected undead also act confused on the round after the false dawn appears.~
@1038572 = ~Dolorous Decay (Alteration, Necromancy)
Level: 6
Sphere: Combat, Necromantic
Range: 10 yards
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell affects a single living creature. Dolorous Decay is a rotting and withering of the body that spreads throughout the afflicted creature quickly. The target creature will automatically be slowed for two rounds. Furthermore, if the target fails a saving throw vs. poison at a -2 penalty, he or she will receive 1 point of damage per second until a total of 50 points of damage have been inflicted.~ []
@1038574 = ~Wondrous Recall (Alteration)
Level: 6
Sphere: Charm, Creation
Range: 0
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This enables the caster to bring back into memory two spells that have been previously cast. If no spells have been cast yet, then nothing happens. Wondrous recall cannot recall 6th-level or greater spells.~
@1038576 = ~Bolt of Glory (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 6
Sphere: Combat, Summoning
Range: 20 yards
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the priest channels a bolt of divine energy against one creature. No attack roll is needed. Creatures struck suffer varying damage, depending on their plane of existence.

Creature Type                       Damage
 Prime Material Plane            6d6
 Elemental                             3d4

@1038580 = ~Sol's Searing Orb (Invocation)
Level: 6
Sphere: Sun
Range: 30 yards
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Target
Saving Throw: Special

When the spell is completed, it creates a glowing stone. This gem must be immediately thrown at an opponent, for it quickly becomes too hot to hold. It is not possible for the priest to give the stone to another character to throw. The priest must roll normally to hit; he gains a +3 bonus to his attack roll and suffers no penalty for nonweapon proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem can be used to strike any creature, even those hit only by magical weapons. There is no damage bonus, however.
When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6d6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds her for 1d6 rounds. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If successful, only half damage is sustained and the target is not blinded. Undead creatures suffer 12d6 points of fire damage and are blinded for twelve rounds (if applicable) assuming their save is failed. They receive 9d6 points of damage and are blinded for six rounds if the save is successful.~
@1038582 = ~Zone of Sweet Air (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Wards
Range: 30 yards
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special

Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors (including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill). This spell will dismiss all clouds within its area of effect.~ []
@1038585 = ~Alarm 

(Abjuration, Evocation)


Range: 10 yds.'Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 hrs. + ' hr./level'Casting Time: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: Up to 20-ft. cube'Saving Throw: None

When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard causes a selected area to react to the presence of any creature larger than a normal rat--anything larger than about 1 cubic foot in volume or more than about three pounds in weight. The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.)  The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word.~ []
@1038589 = ~Melf's Minute Meteors (Evocation/Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 70 yds
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 target/meteor
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the wizard to summon small globes of fire (one for each level of experience of the caster), which, when thrown, burst upon impact and inflict 1d4 + 3 points of damage, +3 additional fire damage, to the creature struck. The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +5 bonus to the attack roll and with no penalty for range. Each meteor has a +6 level of enchantment. The wizard may discharge up to five missiles per round.~ []
@1038597 = ~Wizard Eye (Divination/Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ capable of sending him visual information. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 feet away, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. A successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell.~ []
@1038600 = ~Limited Wish 
(Conjuration/Summoning, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 7
Range: Unlimited
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities (the spell can, for example, restore some hit points lost by the wizard). Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Finally, the wiser the wizard, the better the chance that he or she will choose the right wording. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~ []
@1038605 = ~I shall send a mage to meet you there and arrange for the doors to be opened. Here, you shall need these stakes if you are to truly finish these creatures.~ []
@1038608 = ~This flail has been in the care of Lord de'Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiates when assembled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity with magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

@1039179 = ~A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield. Unlike the small shield, however, a medium shield's weight prevents the bearer from using his or her shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield. Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from 3 to 4 feet in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to resembling a dragon's spread wings. A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward. This is a magical shield.

@1039436 = ~This ancient tome creaks as you open it. Each page of the Book of Infinite Spells contains a spell described in layman's terms, easy enough for a thief, a cleric or even a fighter to understand and cast. Each spell on a page can be cast once per day. A second function of the book is to turn to a different page of the book. This allows for the possibility of getting a better spell. However, once the page has been turned the previous spell is lost forever, unless it happens to appear again.

Be warned. Once you turn to the last page of the book, you are stuck with that spell.

Stinking Cloud (Evocation) 
Level: 2
Range: 30 yards 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

When a Stinking Cloud is cast, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 30 yards away from his or her position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be sent reeling and fall down for 1-2 rounds. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A dispel magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud then they are still subject to its effects.~ []

Burning Hands (Alteration) 
Level: 1
Range: 5 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 60 degree arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his or her fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: the thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets five feet in length, in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3 + 20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spells receive half damage.~ []
@1039443 = ~Dwarven Thrower, War Hammer +3
This hammer -- not to be confused with the elven made Dwarf Thrower -- is only usable by dwarves. In the capable hands of a dwarven warrior, the hammer may be thrown at an opponent. The magic in the hammer draws it back to the hand of its wielder. If it hits an opponent, it does double the damage that a thrown hammer would normally do. Against giants and ogres the hammer does an additional +8 damage, due to the special hatred that dwarves hold for these races.

@1039444 = ~Hammer of Thunderbolts

A dwarven smith, Silverblade, forged this hammer and two other items: a girdle of giant strength and gauntlets of ogre power. His intention was to gift them to his son, who was then a high officer in the dwarven armies, fighting the giant and ogre tribes of the area. Unfortunately Silverblade's son died just after the completion of the three items, and before they could be gifted to him. In his grief Silverblade himself donned the girdle and the gauntlets. Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts, he went to battle against the giant folk, and died valiantly. 
Alone, the Hammer of Thunderbolts is a powerful magical weapon, but when merged with the gauntlets of ogre power and a girdle of giant strength the hammer is transformed. This transformation requires magical assistance. The Hammer of Thunderbolts is then capable of doing an additional +8 damage as well as instantly killing any golem, ettin or troll that it strikes.

This ancient bronze sword is set with six matching bloodstones, and was apparently forged for Azoun the First, a long dead king of Cormyr.

Despite the aid of its illusionary magic, that unnamed soldier fell in a later battle, and the sword was lost to brigands or scavengers.

One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge. Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge. Despite his focused hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.

Whether it was created specifically for use in the service of Torm, or appropriated at some point in the long history of the church, Paladins of the Loyal Fury have made good use of Daystar in their battles against evil undead. Through magic or blessing it is empowered with the Sunray, a force of pure life energy so potent that it slays both living and unliving.

@1039454 = ~Long Sword +2: Ras, The Dancing Blade
Beroalf was a barbarian who traveled from the cold north in search of adventure. He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village. Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage. The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade. Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless, and wielded the sword for many years. How they were ultimately separated is not known.

Basalin was a large man, rumored to be a were-bear. He long wielded the sword Albruin in the protection of his village, slaying giant spiders which plagued the area.

This blade belonged to Dabbar, a long dead servant of Bhaal who exercised control over his minions in the most brutal of ways. In addition to strengthening the mind against the guile of others, the sword absorbs life energy from an opponent with each successful hit, healing the user. Dabbar considered it a failure of his officers if he returned from battle in less than perfect health, and as the rest of the company watched, he would administer beatings until fully healed.

Also known as Neversleep, this ancient blade is thought to have been present at some of the most influential conflicts in Faerun's history. Sightings have been noted as far north as Thay and as far south as the jungles of Chult, though documentation is oddly lacking regarding the details. This is perhaps a result of the sword's ability to silence all sound within a large radius, removing the effectiveness of attacking mages, but also preventing any discussion that might have followed.

Dungeon-delving Lehorgan was lucky indeed to discover this Halruaan blade in the ruins of the ancient sorcerer Kullon's haunt, for it would save his life that very day. The ghost of Kullon himself attacked the intruder, but the flames that followed only singed, absorbed into the glowing Bloodbrand. Concealing himself, Lehorgan watched in amazement as the ancient sorcerer tried to divine his location and again the sword protected him. Surviving this brush with death, the young man used this second chance and the gold from selling the blade to, as he put it, "get the hell out of adventuring."

This blade belonged to Ho Mang, a traveler from Kara-Tur who accepted dubious service at court throughout Faerun. Skilled in "persuasion," he would use this sword to perform the "Death Of A Thousand Cuts," an ancient ritual from his homeland involving a lengthy series of small, painful incisions. The properties of the blade prevent blood from clotting, and his victims would slowly bleed to death. The sword was stolen, and its whereabouts have been a mystery until now.

@1039464 = ~Katana +1
It is no simple deed to enchant a katana. Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword. Improving it further usually requires a sacrifice; perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into his sword. The wielder of an enchanted katana such as this one must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried the blade into battle. Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

@1039466 = ~Wakizashi +1
The wakizashi, or companion sword, is extremely important to samurai. It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night. As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi is a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, and is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user. Wu Jen masters have concealed within this wakizashi great power, unleashed only when the wielder is in the thick of battle. How or why this wakizashi made it to Faerun is unknown, but if the samurai who owned it still lives, he will certainly be looking for it.

The sword of the ninja, the ninja-to, is of lower quality than other Kara-Tur blades such as the katana. The ninja-to is short with a straight blade, making it ideal for the subterfuge of the ninja. The ninja-to is also more suited to fighting in closed places, sometimes giving the ninja an advantage over those using longer blades such as the samurai used.

@1039469 = ~Scimitar +1, Shazzellim 
This scimitar is of rather poor quality, but beneath its surface lies great power and evil. Created for the sole purpose of slaying Harpers, Shazzellim is more than capable of that task. With one strike of the blade a bard must make a saving throw vs. spells or die. Crafted by a Red Wizard of Thay, the sword also has the ability to vocalize, which is why it was often given to fighter-mages in the service of the Wizards. Needless to say, possession of this sword would not be looked upon very highly by Harpers.

@1039470 = ~Two Handed Sword +3: Harbinger
When the hero Trueblood destroyed the Harbinger, a demon gorging itself on the blood of peasant folk near Luskan, he bound its essence in the only vessel capable of holding it, his fabled sword, Deliverance. Though the evil creature was dominated by the will of the semi-sentient blade, it was not truly defeated, and it transformed the weapon from within. Now it acts much like any other enchanted weapon, but when it strikes, there is a small chance that a fireball erupts, a sign that the demon within still rages at its imprisonment. There is also a chance that any ogre it hits will be turned to stone. Whether this is an ability of the demon or a vestigial power of the original blade is not known.

A social faux pas placed upstart Andor Licon in a duel with Baron Eeirk, heir to a warrior king. Though they seemed of even skill, Andor grew oddly weaker with each hit of the Baron's family blade. Panicking, he bade his bodyguards kill Eeirk. Despite his claims of morality, some noted that the young noble had positioned his men before the duel was even underway, and though he professed disdain for its dark magic, Andor made a tidy fortune off the sale of the evil blade.

Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, so that the sword itself will never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today. It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it. The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, for their magic is dispelled with a word, and steadfastly resisted with ease. Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

The title does not refer to the blade itself, but rather to the woman who originally wielded it in the icy hinterlands of Faerun. Her name was Carerra, and she was a veritable firestorm that swept across arctic trolls and the northern orcish tribes. She was a hated enemy of many a shaman whose magic often floundered against her fury. After a lifetime of raucous battle, it was old age that eventually claimed her. The sword was passed to her granddaughter, an adventurer, who presumably brought it to Amn.

Ardulia met his match one spring morn, however, when he battled the priest Itgan, who wielded this mace. Ardulia seemed to stagger under each blow, slowing his pace to recoup and regain his breath. Without his speed, Ardulia was lost, and fell to the measured attacks of Itgan.

Bower Necaradan crafted this masterpiece almost thirty years ago, lacing strong enchantments within both the wood and the string. It is said he only fired it once, just to see if it performed as true as he had hoped. He was reportedly not disappointed, but a local nobleman sought the bow soon after, and it eventually fell into the hands of bandits.

A devastating weapon, this crossbow unfortunately draws its power directly from the wielder. Some bowmen have used it regardless, and many to great effect, but the drawbacks must be carefully considered. Its most famous owner, Guil de Lyons, made good use of it fighting bandits in remote areas of Faerun, but he ultimately fell when he lacked the strength to defend against a rare assailant that got within striking distance.

This composite longbow was one of many made by a half-elven craftsman whose name has been lost to history. At one time there were several hundred in use, favored by scouts who patrolled the Anauroch desert, but many have been lost or destroyed. Only a few are still known to exist, and they see little use due to the tremendous strength they require.

Legends say that craftsman Pinn O'Reffen fashioned this bow from the heart of a Treant, though how he came to possess such material is unknown. He certainly did not anticipate the enchantment within, magic that makes the archer's aim almost infallible for a short period every day. Pinn claimed his skill was responsible, but it is more likely that some aspect of the soul of the Treant is still within the wood. This bow requires a strength of 18 to use.

This massive bow was the property of the ranger Bearpaw, who reportedly received it from a strangely benevolent ogre. The reason for the gift was never discussed, but he earned the respect of everyone he met, and likely befriended the creature while patrolling the Cloakwood Forest. Bearpaw could draw back the bowstring without the slightest effort, but when he died it was bequeathed to his wife and sons, and not a one could draw the string even halfway. They eventually sold it to a merchant heading south.

This yew bow is more a work of art than a weapon of war; fine engravings dance over the polished wood, and the bowstring gleams of gold, almost singing when drawn. This was a ceremonial bow in the Elven Court for a thousand years, though that is scarcely a single lifetime in elven terms. Every 50 years or so it was granted to someone who had performed a great service, the recipient eventually choosing who would hold it next. Two centuries ago a human, Yin Pon, rescued an elven prince and was gifted the bow, which he carried with him to Baldur's Gate, where it was subsequently lost.

The thin, frayed string of this bow appears unusable, but when it is drawn a solid but invisible arrow becomes tangible. The lich Tansheron gave this bow to his Watcher, the guardian of his keep who stood atop a tower with neither entrance nor exit. When anyone approached, down would fall a never-ending rain of phantom arrows until they died or fled. How this bow was wrested from the Watcher's hand is not known, but would probably make a great tavern story.

Note: avoid equipping normal arrows on your character, else the bow will fire these instead of the phantom arrows.

None know better than halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe. This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that left the hearth to seek adventure. Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for a more humorous than lethal effect. It would seem that halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to history.

Gulen Rockfire, Slayer of Undead, crafted this powerful throwing axe expressly for reinforcing his claim to his namesake. Blessed by a cross-section of gods, this weapon does phenomenal damage against creatures unwisely rebelling against their deceased status, and can potentially destroy them in a single blow. Obviously Gulen no longer carries Azuredge, and it is rumored that he died fighting a powerful vampire years ago, only to rise as one himself. This may have softened his stance regarding the undead, at the very least prompting a change of name.

With the help of his dwarven friends he succeeded, creating several of the famous Fullen Boomerang daggers.

The Dragonslayers met their match in a cantankerous ancient red who slew the entire group in an epic battle. This weapon did not end up in the beast's hoard, however, since the creature returned to its lair to recuperate; when it emerged, the field of combat was well scavenged.

Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshipping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago."  Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold. When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent, it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor, who sought to rule. There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself.

@1039627 = ~Staff of the Magi
This type of staff is thoroughly linked to the image of the spellcasting profession, rare though it is. It is among the most powerful tools that a wizard can possess, the culmination of complex enchantment and endless study. This particular example is potent in melee, grants Invisibility, and offers protection from Charm and Evil. It can also cast a Spell Trap, launch a Fireball-Lighting Bolt combination, and Dispel Magic. In short, it is the quintessential mage item.

@1039629 = ~Staff of Thunder and Lightning +2
There are stories that tell of such staves sprouting in the undergrowth around druid groves when the forest is threatened. Fanciful tales, but whether they are true or not, this staff is a powerful tool. It draws energy from storms, and there is a chance that any blow may trigger a thunderclap that knocks enemies down. It casts Lightning Bolt, and if circumstances warrant it, it can Call Lightning to blast enemies to dust.  Some abilities are limited by charges.

@1039630 = ~Staff of the Woodlands
Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood," the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil. Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, a feature that would fade if the staff were set aside. He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him with a dozen hunting dogs or more. The animals seemed ready to rip the poor druid to pieces, but he quickly turned them on their former masters. Rushing forward in hopes of a quick victory, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.

@1039631 = ~Staff of Air
This staff seems to draw upon elven artistic traditions, though tied less to the forest than is usually customary. It was apparently designed to control air elementals, for it is able to summon one as a servant to the wielder, and potentially destroy creatures of the same type in a single blow. When necessary, it can also spawn a cloud of gas causing anyone within the area of effect to fall into a deep slumber. Some effects are limited by charges.

There was a time when magic was distrusted even more so than now, and the burning of "heretics" was woefully common. Delmarey, a witch from the swamplands near Myth Rynn, faced just such a fate when she was blamed for an unseasonable drought. Taken by surprise and sentenced by a mob, she was put to the torch in the village square. With her dying breath she uttered a foul curse, fueling the fire to an unstoppable magnitude. By dawn, the entire village was reduced to black coal, save the burnt remains of the pole Delmarey had been bound to. This staff has been imbued with some remnants of Delmarey's power, making it a highly enchanted weapon.

These modified boots of speed were originally intended to boost the wearer's speed rating even more so than would normal boots of speed. When used, the wearer's movement rate increases as if under the effect of normal boots of speed combined with a haste spell. Unfortunately, the wearer cannot attack, and the strain of rushing around so fast quickly tires even the most stalwart of heroes. Their nick-name is 'Heel of the Coward,' for that summarizes their most obvious use: running away.

Critics may ask how an elf could get lost in his own wood, but that and other discrepancies have not stopped the story from being retold. The item's real history has been buried beneath the fiction.

@1039923 = ~Accept? No, they could not do much. It is not uncommon for a fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN> to take possession of a keep once the lord of the manor is... is dead.~ []
@1039926 = ~This will benefit us both! You gain status while my home is maintained as befits my father. It is not uncommon to take over a keep when the lord is... is dead.~ []

@1039955 = ~Ring of Spell Turning
A gift to Derek Poodon, apprentice warrior, this ring was his salvation when he stumbled upon two Red Wizards traveling the Cloakwood Forest. Enraged at being disturbed, the mages unleashed a score of Magic Missiles at the seemingly helpless Derek, but to their brief surprise, the assault reflected back and killed them both. Thereafter, without having lifted his blade, Derek was rather sheepishly known as Derek the Red Slayer.

Level: 5
Range: Caster 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2 

A sunfire is like a fireball: it is an explosive burst of flame which detonates with a low roar, and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it (1d6 points of damage for each level of experience, up to a maximum of 15d6). The wizard gestures with his hand and the entire area around him erupts in flames, striking all except for the caster. Creatures who successfully make their saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, and receive half damage.~ []

(Conjuration,Summoning) 
Level: 8
Range: 30 yards
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 12-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the caster to inscribe a symbol of power on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area of effect to to make a save vs. death or die. Creatures with more than 60 current hit points are immune to this effect.~ []
@1039970 = ~A buckler, also known as a target shield, is a small shield of wood or metal that fastens to the forearm. Because of its size it is light and can be worn with very little restriction to movement. This buckler has some form of generic enchantment, making it more resistant to blows.

As cries of rage traveled the halls you were forced to reluctantly escape through a side passage... even with your skills, a crowd of both peasants and guardsmen could not have been held off for long.

By the time you left the keep, the gentlefolk of the land had taken control of the building... likely waiting for knights from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart or even a new lord to come from nearby. Either way, rule of the de'Arnise Keep has been stripped from you... permanently.~ []

@1040776 = ~Magic is all but banned in the city, making many into outlaws. Why would you offer anything?~ []
@1040786 = ~I'm listening.~ []
@1040793 = ~I will inquire to my superiors about her if you wish. Until then, I would advise that you act in accordance with this agreement.~ []
@1040795 = ~If you display magic in the streets unlicensed you will be censured accordingly. The lives of a few brethren are apparently an acceptable price for your assistance.~ []
@1040797 = ~I will go along with this for the moment.~ []
@1040812 = ~I bring three young mages. They have shown potential, and have been removed from their homes that they might be cultivated into productive Cowled Wizards.~ []
@1040819 = ~I'm sure. Next is Larz. He found some old magic texts and studied without his parents' knowledge. They feared the stigma he would bring and cast him out.~ []
@1040824 = ~I will serve as best I can, <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1040840 = ~Here! Here is the fight! I regret that I cannot join the fray, as I must report to the Order the enemy's numbers and tactics! Even if all my friends should fall, someone must live to report of this.~ []
@1040843 = ~Keep close by my side. The Baron would prefer it if you did not speak to any of the squatters before the meeting. He fears your view of him would be... tainted.~ []
@1040845 = ~Hold! I warn you, I have killed many of your brethren to get this... oh, forgive my manner. I feared you were another grouping of orcs come to harass me.~ []
@1040853 = ~We'll have to find my aunt's bedroom. There's a secret passage within that leads to the cellar entrance. Down there is probably where the leader is.~ [NALIA82]

@1040862 = ~Uh, yeah, that's why I'm here. Yeah. The Tomb.~ []
@1040865 = ~Uh, yeah, that's why I'm here. Yeah. The Tomb.~ []
@1040866 = ~Ho, friends! I heard much commotion and have come down to investigate.  What transpires, here?~ []
@1040887 = ~A fellow's been in the inn for the past couple of days. Meeting with Raelis, I think... a director of some note, as I was told. He was at the bar last night, mentioning he was between projects.~ []
@1040895 = ~Hmm... I was approached by a Lord Jierdan Firkraag. He seemed to suggest that I would need his approval if I was to make it through here.~ []
@1040896 = ~I haven't had much trouble though. There were a few orcs, but they seemed to be afraid of this area.~ []
@1040898 = ~... but we needn't get into that. Goodman Thunderburp has told me your situation, and I would be pleased to offer my service as director of this fine concern!~ []
@1040906 = ~Historically speaking, yes. I am an academic, not some cutesy well-bosomed relic hunter. You may be able to help me. Care to talk about a partnership of sorts?~ []
@1040940 = ~Oh all right, I'll help.~ []
@1040942 = ~So you did manage to stumble your way into victory. Expect no reward beyond what you've undoubtedly stolen from my home. The sooner you're away from here, the better.~ [DELCIA07]
@1040951 = ~Blast. I hoped to get you to do the grunt-work. I'll do it, but not with you at my back. You'd leave me dead and take whatever I found... that's what I was planning.~ []
@1040953 = ~Akae! The plan did not work! Strike now!~ []
@1040955 = ~Oh no, you'll not threaten me. Think you'll get me to do the work and then take what I earn? No <SIRMAAM>. I won't fall for my own plan.~ []
@1040962 = ~What? Blast, why did I waste my time of this idiotic plan. Did you hear that, Akae! Your stupid plan has failed! We'll be doing it ourselves, just as I thought!~ []
@1040965 = ~Sorry to crush any illusions you had about this academic adventure, but I'm more concerned with how much I can sell these little trinkets for.~ []
@1040973 = ~Eh? Excuse me... I'm trying to get into character! Can't you see that?!~ []
@1040977 = ~'Tis a grand thing to have the Council anoint the playhouse so. And an even greater honor to be a part of the troupe that done it. This will be a great place someday... a fine, honorable theater.~ []
@1040995 = ~Grr... I am a guardian. Many the Drow did fall in the cleansing, but red came a Wing to their call and their aid.~ []
@1041001 = ~I didn't know they ever kept a steady playhouse in Athkatla. People here... aren't the real theater-going type. Can't show off your wealth enough, I guess...~ []
@1041007 = ~The path past the fire leads to rest well deserved, the path past the fire is clear to his eyes.~ []
@1041012 = ~What! You are no more a hero than those blasted monsters! What has become of this land!?~ []
@1041043 = ~Yes, yes, enough with the chatter.~ []
@1041051 = ~He's always been like that. Won't even hunt if he's having a bad fur day.~ []
@1041065 = ~Do you see? Do you see how our enemies fall? Obey your new guild, <CHARNAME>, and it will not be necessary for you to join the thieves in death. Obey, and you shall benefit Mistress Bodhi, and yourself.~ []
@1041073 = ~Higgold! Do not mention its name! Call it 'the Turmish play' if you must. It is a masterpiece of theater, but the curse is real and you should heed it!~ []
@1041096 = ~Remember this battle. Remember that the Shadow Thieves protect their friends, and exact painful penance from their rival guilds, no matter how strong or guarded.~ []
@1041100 = ~At minimum, a bare-bones production, we can get by on 1,000 gold pieces. Of course extra would make the play that much more presentable.~ []
@1041101 = ~I am not willing to put in 1,000 gp, Higgold.~ []
@1041102 = ~I do not have 1,000 gp to put into this, Higgold...~ []
@1041103 = ~Very well. I suppose 1,000 gp is good enough... but I am willing to part with no more.~ []
@1041104 = ~I can afford to put in a bit more than 1,000 gp, I suppose.~ []
@1041109 = ~I suppose I could afford more than 1,000 gp.~ []

@1041144 = ~The temple was once dedicated to Amaunator, a god of the sun, and a great prophetess is buried within. It was holy ground once, though now it is fouled.~ []
@1041145 = ~Rumors and hearsay. I am here before you as the proverbial horse's mouth. You may take what I say at my word, or you will end like all the others will.~ []
@1041150 = ~Some weeks ago, muted rumblings were heard beneath the temple. We paid little heed to them until the skies darkened and the shadows deepened.~ []
@1041182 = ~Once they were all dead his darkness reached out to the corpses of my children and animated them as shade wolves. Numb with terror and sorrow, I ran.~ []
@1041187 = ~Hmph! Women! Anyway, the situation has been resolved. All is proceeding normally, except perhaps for some hurt feelings. Nothing new to the theater, though.~ []
@1041190 = ~A problem has arisen, I fear. Strange noises and things going missing, <CHARNAME>. The actors are spooked... they think it's the curse.~ [BDHIGG10]
@1041192 = ~There's no end of complications, are there. If it weren't for the curse everything would be running fine! (sigh)  This had better all be worth it, that's all I can say.~ []
@1041194 = ~There's no end of complications, are there. The cast is jittery, mad, sniping at each other... HAH! Actors are like children, but the play WILL be ready, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~ []
@1041196 = ~There's no end of complications, are there. Bloody actors! Bah! All I ask is for them to ACT! You'd think they'd be willing to do THAT!~ []
@1041197 = ~There's no end of complications, are there. There were Turmish fanatics here, protesting the play. They ruined a lot of props before the guard ousted them.~ []
@1041198 = ~The play is coming along rather well, my patron. The dress rehearsal is tomorrow, once we clean up this mess. Best you go get some rest and let me take care of this.~ [BDHIGG11]
@1041201 = ~Good, the <PRO_LADYLORD> patron is here!  Now maybe <PRO_HESHE> can do something about you!~
@1041204 = ~A coincidence. And my style is my own; do not be so petty. Perhaps if you were a better actress you would not worry so.~ []
@1041210 = ~Oh, good... it's the <PRO_LADYLORD> patron.  Now, maybe <PRO_HESHE> can do something about you and your attitude.~
@1041241 = ~Be quiet, fool! We... we don't want to alarm this... wait a minute.~ []
@1041244 = ~I know you! You are <CHARNAME>, or at least part of <PRO_HISHER> group. I don't think I met <PRO_HIMHER> in person, but I heard what happened. Joined with that other guild, <PRO_HESHE> did.~ []
@1041249 = ~I guess we don't have to worry about you turning us in to the Shadow Thieves. Hey, if you can give us a good word in the new guild we would appreciate it.~ []
@1041254 = ~Better pick the right side when it comes time to choose. I know I am. Good luck to you.~ []
@1041259 = ~Yeah... Aw heck, <HESHE>'s not buying it, I just know it. I guess we make our choice now then!~ []
@1041268 = ~Ahh, <CHARNAME>, creature of shadow, or at least, Shadow Thieves. A pity you had not made a different decision when the time came to choose. A pity your taste in guilds was not different.~ []
@1041313 = ~Mere stories, told to frighten you into staying with a dying organization. Why would they fear competition? Because they are weak.~ []
@1041354 = ~Yes, I currently work for the Shadow Thieves.~ []
@1041355 = ~Yes, I currently work for the Shadow Thieves.~ []
@1041356 = ~Yes, I currently work for the Shadow Thieves.~ []
@1041364 = ~Then you are to renounce your guild and join with us, or you will die! Is that... wait... I know you. You are <CHARNAME>, and you serve the Mistress.~ []

@1041789 = ~Yes <PRO_SIRMAAM>, one Wand of the Apprenti coming right up. Simple, easy, and I really hope it works.~ []

@1041895 = ~The third is... is from the advanced class. I borrowed a tome from a friend of mine who said no one has attempted it in years. It is armor for a mage. It is a Staff of Power, and will cost... 10,000 gold.~ []

@1041918 = ~Ready to direct our lessons, <CHARNAME>? The choices available were the Wand of the Apprenti for 1,000, the Dagger of <CHARNAME> for 250, and the Ring of Protection for 2,000.~ []
@1041928 = ~There is Mislead which will cost 250 gold in supplies, Horrid Wilting at 1,000 gold, and Meteor Swarm at 2,500 gold. That is also the order of difficulty.~ []

@1041934 = ~Very well. Please, return before I regain my senses and decide these things are better left to archmagi.~ []
@1041935 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>? Are you able to supply the needed gold? 250 for the Robe of the Apprenti, 3,000 for the Ring of Wizardry, or... or 10,000 for the Staff of Power.~ []
@1041940 = ~Wait, wait! I must still raise the gold for these things.~ []
@1041948 = ~This tomb has been cracked open and anything of value has been removed. Looters have broken the fingers of the corpse, no doubt to take something it was holding.~ []
@1041950 = ~Amulet of Power
This amulet bears the signature enchantments of Conster Damon, an archmage that fell in the Year of the Dracorage (1018DR). The crispness of its etchings may have faded with fire and time, but it still echoes his famous defiant cries: "Your magic denied!"  "I will be heard!"  "Defeat comes swiftly!"  "Take nothing from me!"  It has seen much use, and changed hands many times through blood and battle.

@1042068 = ~(sniff!)  I wish I could have been there... bloody sickness just... (sniff!) ... washed over me. It has to be the curse! (sniff!)  Oh, well... at least I'll get to play Velden, still.~ []
@1042075 = ~A pleasure, as always. Ahh, but such a waste to watch your blood drain to the sewers. Can you hear them? The rats are singing.~ []
@1042078 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>, I heard you approach. Did you appreciate the performance? Was it to your liking? I should hope so. You will see it again in future.~ []

@1042136 = ~Bravado, of course. Your kind grows tiresome and predictable yet you may be of some use to me.~ [SHADEL12]
@1042139 = ~Oh, but you shall, mortal. This body that I inhabit grows tired. You shall make an excellent replacement. Come my shades! Open the portal! This brash fool has some strength.~ [SHADEL13]

@1042237 = ~I regret that I do not know how they could be sent home, but if what you say is true they would be honored guests here.~ []
@1042238 = ~Have them come and I shall give them lodgings. There is always evil to strive against, even if they are not in their home plane. They can do their work here.~ []
@1042240 = ~I thank you, though they would rather go home.~ []

@1042276 = ~But, seeing as how they all survived, you are cordially invited to their graduation, which we will be holding right here.~ []
@1042277 = ~They are a small class, and renting a hall would be excessive. I hope you are dressed for it, you are the only guest. It starts in... oh, about 5 minutes.~ []
@1042278 = ~But, seeing as how at least some of them survived your tutelage, you are cordially invited to the graduation ceremony, which will be held right here.~ []
@1042284 = ~Wait, I need to know if you can help me send these Solamnic Knights home.~ []
@1042291 = ~And before you ask, no, I have no information about Imoen. I will ask again, because I know you will pester me.~ []
@1042304 = ~Well, that was certainly unpleasant. Sorry I... sorry I wasn't much help, but I... I... sprained a... casting finger. Heh heh...~ [TEOSXX07]
@1042308 = ~You are not the only one with enemies. The Cowled Wizards have many. Some are incredibly fanatical as well.~ []
@1042323 = ~That is unfortunate. Such an abrupt end to this long relationship. I will almost miss you. Almost. Farewell then.~ []
@1042325 = ~All right, I will help.~ []
@1042326 = ~You are now barred from entering the sphere. It's a little spell we've been working on. So sorry.~ []
@1042327 = ~Good and good. Here is the rune. Be careful; it will only work on Lord Argrim and it has a frightfully long casting time.~ []
@1042337 = ~Whatever, just do it. If he continues magic use will be grounds for torture and executions, not imprisonment. He is the greater of two evils.~ []
@1042346 = ~A noble cause that I shall be glad to help you with.~ []

@1042529 = ~Hail, good people, I welcome you to Trademeet. Mind not the worried stares of our citizens while you are here. Strangers are not easily trusted these days.~ []
@1042534 = ~Hail, I welcome you to Trademeet. I trust you will not earn the worried stares you have received so far?~ [CELOGA02]
@1042568 = ~Until recently we did not know where to place blame, but now the people have found a target. The last group attacked saw several figures directing the chaos.~ []
@1042575 = ~Hardly. Tensions have just made people quick to judge. If you had appeared a tenday ago you would have found your welcome colder still.~ []
@1042595 = ~I am anxious about this new group. It is rumored that it is led by a woman, but we know nothing of her, not even her name.~ []
@1042623 = ~So ends the Noontide Ritual.~ []
@1042628 = ~I will recite the Tenets of the Faith.~ []
@1042629 = ~I will recite the Tenets of the Faith.~ []
@1042668 = ~I should have crept quietly as the vine instead of blustering as the wind. On occasion I forget the subtleties that allow nature to progress.~ []

@1042711 = ~No one is safe in Trademeet, many are panicking. They blame the druids, and no druid -- or any outsider-- is welcome within the town at the moment.~ []
@1042713 = ~Your ruin continues with the devastation of Garren Windspear in your name. Away goes his child from under your nose, and I wonder who shall bear the blame!~ []
@1042738 = ~I'm sure there is a reason... but it isn't anything we've done. Trademeet is a peaceful town where business is conducted fairly... blessed by Waukeen herself!~ []
@1042756 = ~I don't know what kind of reward the mayor is offering, but that's a possibility. The town would be grateful to be rid of this menace, that much I know.~ []
@1042763 = ~You seek Imoen, your lost comrade. I am prepared to give you her location, and the means with which to reach her.~ [BODHIX30]
@1042773 = ~I know much and will share it. You do not know the full picture of the man, and I cannot blame you for your cautiousness.~ []
@1042777 = ~It is true that Irenicus was your captor, and indeed, your stay in his care was not the most comfortable, but there were circumstance that you are not aware of.~ []
@1042779 = ~Irenicus requested a service of the Shadow Thieves, for which they demanded your capture as payment. You are of great interest to them, as you probably know.~ []
@1042788 = ~I will get to that in a moment. While you were in Jon's... 'care' he discovered the potential you have, and resolved to aid your development.~ []
@1042794 = ~Trademeet is a peaceful town... we haven't even had the Sythillisian Empire to worry about, yet. And yet we are attacked by wild animals... it is almost beyond belief!~ []
@1042817 = ~But I do! I do! Listen to me... it won't stop with the animals. Soon, the floods will come... an' the storms! Trademeet will be washed away, you'll see.~ []
@1042831 = ~So you would betray your 'brother' even as you rescue him? He deserves worse.~ []
@1042834 = ~What was the nature of the fight with the Shadow Thieves?~ []
@1042838 = ~That I cannot tell. Likely they wished to observe or interrogate. Either way, they wished you alive. That has probably changed with your recent actions, however.~ []
@1042840 = ~They're jus' waitin' for the big genie to come an' kill us all. The gods are angry. If not the genies, it'll be them Sythillisian ogres. One or the other.~ []
@1042842 = ~You ask too much of me. I have already paid a large amount of gold for your help.~ []
@1042845 = ~Sythillisian ogres?~ []
@1042847 = ~You don't know about th' genies holdin' all o' Trademeet hostage? They owns everythin'... gold, supplies, food. An' they won't give none of it up.~ []
@1042851 = ~Just outside o' Riatavin... thousands of monsters, all under a bunch o' ogres. Taken over half of Amn. Just let 'em all in to deal with the genies, I says.~ []
@1042854 = ~It will not interfere. You will reach Irenicus and Imoen with ease, for they are both in the same place; a horrible place designed to hold the strong-willed.~ []
@1042858 = ~What was the nature of the fight with the Shadow Thieves?~ []
@1042859 = ~You ask too much of me. I have already paid a large amount of gold for your help.~ []

@1042897 = ~The island it is located on is under its own rule, and even the Cowled Wizards are not certain what becomes of those sent there.~ []
@1042898 = ~It is considered a necessary evil, and like so many other evils, no one really wanted to deal with it once it began.~ []
@1042899 = ~I have used your gold to secure passage to the isle. You will have to contend with the asylum itself, and with the pirates that run the isle.~ []
@1042915 = ~Anyway, it is with great honor that I welcome our graduates to the... er... stage. Morul, Larz, Nara, you are mages today.~ []
@1042917 = ~Duh. We'd be dead.~ []
@1042918 = ~Oh shush. <CHARNAME>, we certainly appreciate this.~ []
@1042920 = ~But under the benevolent yoke of the Cowled Wizards you will be somewhat protected from arrest. Go forth into that brave new world, quietly and carefully.~ []
@1042925 = ~Hehe, oh those wacky kids. Celebrations all around!~ []
@1042930 = ~Oooh, that burns. Anyway, that's it for our ceremonies. Morul, you can now look forward to a long career under the benevolent yoke of the Cowled Wizards.~ []
@1042931 = ~Go softly and quietly into the real world, and I'm sure you will be mostly safe from arrest and persecution.~ []
@1042933 = ~Graduating class of 1369DR, we salute you.~ []
@1042935 = ~Oooh, that burns.~ []
@1042941 = ~She and the others involved in the disturbance were taken into custody, that much you know. They proved too unruly for simple incarceration.~ []
@1042942 = ~They are no longer in the city. I could get nothing further from my superiors, and I expect that asking for more would yield a harsh response.~ []
@1042947 = ~Hold, traveler. What is your business here in Athkatla?~ []
@1042950 = ~Now really, there is no cause for that.~ []
@1042970 = ~You'll pay you will, or yous get a face full of fist. That's pretty clear, isn't it?~ []
@1042976 = ~Fight! Kill him!~ []
@1042979 = ~I'm not doing a thing. It's amusing, so I'm going to watch.~ []
@1042985 = ~That's it? You're not going to help? What kind of people are you!~ []
@1042991 = ~So you're all bluff and no bite, eh? Get outta here, before I tie your toes in a knot!~ []
@1042993 = ~I knew that fool was all bluster and no muster, but thanks for your help all the same.~ []
@1043005 = ~Such things are not for you to know... yet. When the time comes you will know much, and if the Mistress bids it, you may also live.~ []
@1043008 = ~I know you not, but you are the enemy of those that would help me!~ []
@1043014 = ~No more so than you! Why did you attack Irenicus? His capture deprived me of my revenge!~ []

It has also been bestowed with a small number of magical properties, thus making it more effective in combat.

@1043178 = ~I thank you for this act of charity, disguised though it is.~ []

@1043188 = ~Now walk away, and see to your little rescue efforts. Take your time. Enjoy life. You have much to face.~ []

@1043350 = ~That said, I don't suppose there is much harm in stating plainly that walking the streets at night are a danger.~ []
@1043358 = ~Hungry wolves, we thought at first. A bear wandering too close to town. My brother-in-law was nearly mauled by a jaguar while traveling through the woods.~ []
@1043379 = ~We don't keep many prisoners here, but the ones we have are usually kept in the High Merchant's manor... until they're sent to Athkatla, that is.~ []

@1043459 = ~Hmmmn. I would say, mortal, that I wish the head of this rakshasi returned to me... and once that was done, despite the amusements we have found here, the Dao would return to Calimshan.~ []

@1043524 = ~You must be careful, mortal one! Ihtafeer is a ruhk, a knight of the rakshasa... she is a wondrous being of magic and may only be struck by the most powerful magic, herself! Cautious, cautious, little mortal!~ []

If you have played the original Baldur's Gate you may already be familiar with many of these functions, though the tutorial is still a convenient way to re-familiarize yourself with the interface in a safe environment.~ []
@1044201 = ~Stiletto of Demarchess +2
Most who take up the trade of murder for hire do so for reasons other than personal pleasure, but not so the Lady Demarche. She took special pleasure in the torture of her targets, which is why she made this dagger. With but one touch of its polished blade an opponent was rendered immobile, incapable of so much as screaming, yet the victim could watch and feel all that happened to them. While her opponent was thus held, the Lady would slowly bleed them, sometimes taking several hours before allowing her subject to succumb to the final agony of death. The Lady finally fell victim to her own evil; disarmed by a rival and struck by her own stiletto, her fate was soon sealed.

Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: Sight of the caster
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell is only available to Harpers. The Harper's Call restores a comrade to life, to further serve the cause of the Harpers. This spell functions similarly to Raise Dead, with the following exceptions: the Harper must transfer a small portion of her life essence (10 hit points) to successfully raise the deceased person; the target has but 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic; and the raised person suffers a -5 penalty to all ability scores for one minute, making this spell virtually useless in combat.~ []

The origins of this ring are unclear, and while its enchantments share similarities with historical examples of Rings of Wizardry, there is something strange in how it feels, either in the weight of the metal or in the aura it projects, and it does not function the same. It was likely found on some distant plane, and as such, its maker will remain a mystery to you.

@1044943 = ~Iron Skins (Alteration)
Level: 5
Sphere: Elemental
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this powerful spell, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground and completely cover the druid. This skin is magical, will not hinder the movements of the druid, and will protect the druid from physical attacks. For every 2 levels of the caster an additional skin is gained upon casting (a 10th level druid would receive 5 skins, while a 20th level druid would receive 10). Each skin the druid possesses will stop one attack (and be destroyed in the process). The skins will remain on the druid until dispelled, until all of the skins are destroyed from absorbing attacks, or until the spell duration expires.~ []
@1044946 = ~Nature's Beauty (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental
Range: Caster
Duration: Instant 
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg

When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation. The caster becomes the very ideal of beauty; for a male, this is usually a nymph, and for a female, the image varies. As with a nymph, anyone viewing the disguised caster must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +3 bonus or die of longing for the denied illusion. Even if the saving throw is successful, hapless viewers of the transformed druid are all instantly smitten with permanent blindness (until dispelled). The transformation is instantaneous and lasts only seconds, affecting all those near the caster (except for fellow party members).~ []

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a small handful of pixie dust that the caster can use to toss into the air. Anyone hit by the dust becomes invisible (the range of the dust is about 15 feet). Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus the invisible being can walk around and cast defensive spells. However, if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first.~

@1045047 = ~Summon Insects (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Sphere: Animal
Range: 30 yds.
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

The summon insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack one enemy of the caster. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to.
The victim may make a saving throw vs. breath weapons (with a -4 penalty) to escape the swarm. Otherwise, the victim receives 1 point of damage every two seconds for the duration of the spell.
The victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% spell failure).~
@1045051 = ~Insect Plague (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: 120 yds.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Enemies within visual range
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm. This swarm will jump first to the target, then to the nearest allies of the target, until six creatures have been affected. Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible (100% failure rate). Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for every two seconds they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. Due to the suffocating nature of the writhing insect swarm, each victim must make a saving vs. breath weapon or run away in fear for a round.~
@1045055 = ~Earthquake (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Level: 7
Range: 120 yds.
Duration: 3 tremors
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by a priest, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect.

There are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake. The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6d6 points of damage (save vs. spell at a -6 penalty for half damage). Those who fail their saving throws fall to the ground for four rounds and drop their weapons.

The second tremor is less severe, causing 3d6 points of damage (save for half at a -2 penalty). Those failing the saving throw will also drop their weapons. The final tremor causes 2d6 damage (save for half) and if the saving throw is failed they will drop their weapons.

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use. Finally, Earth Elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear. This elemental will attack the party.~

@1045850 = ~The answer would be no, and I now demand a yes or no answer from you! 1,000 gold or your lives! Will you pay?~ []
@1045866 = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than wizards, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way wizards do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a wizard.
NOTE:  A sorcerer does NOT learn spells from scrolls, but instead chooses new spells with each level. A sorcerer's prime requisites are INTELLIGENCE and CHARISMA.~ []
@1045867 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

Monks must be of Lawful alignments.

Advantages:
-  The monk can make 1 unarmed attack per round, and gains 1/2 an additional attack every 3 levels to a maximum of 4 attacks per round at level 18.
-  The damage inflicted by the monk's fists goes up as as the monk increases in levels:
Level 1-2:  1-6
Level 3-5:  1-8
Level 6-8:  1-10
Level 9-14:  1-12
Level 15+: 1-20
-  A monk's natural armor class gets better as the monk goes up in levels. Armor class starts off at 9, and then decreases by 1 for every 2 levels until level 21, then every 3 levels until 30, then every 5 levels until 40.
-  Stunning blow, once per day for every 4 levels. All attacks in the next 6 seconds force the victim to save or be stunned. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  Monks have the Deflect Missiles ability. This gives them a -1 to their AC vs missiles for every 3 levels.
-  The monk gains a +2 to save vs spells
-  A monk starts off moving at +2 move, then +1 move every 5 levels.
-  5th level:  Immunity to all diseases, and cannot be Slowed or Hasted.
-  7th level:  Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level
-  8th level:  -1 to speed factor
-  9th level:  +1 to all saves. Immune to charm. The monk's fist is considered a +1 weapon (+2 at 12th, +3 at 15th)
-  11th level:  Immune to poison
-  12th level:  Another -1 to speed factor.  Fists are considered +2 weapons. 
-  13th level:  Quivering palm spell once per day. This spell gives one hand attack. If an opponent is struck, the opponent must Save Vs. Death or die. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  14th level:  The monk gains 3% innate magic resistance per level (starting a 42% at 14th level, and reaching a maximum of 78%)
-  15th level:  Fists are considered +3 weapons
-  20th level:  Immune to non-magical weapons

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear any armor
-  May not use the off-hand in combat, so may only use one-handed weapons available to the thief class, may not carry a shield, and may not dual-wield (use a second melee weapon.)~ []
@1045869 = ~BARBARIAN: A barbarian can be an excellent warrior. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly be thrown into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent.

Advantages:
-  Moves at 2 points faster than the normal character movement rate
-  Immunity to backstab
-  Can rage once per day per every 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use). Rage gives +4 to constitution and strength for 5 rounds. Gives a 2 point armor class penalty and +2 to saves vs magic (for 5 rounds). Rage also gives immunity to all charm, hold, fear, maze, confusion and level drain spells.
-  At 11th level the barbarian gains 10% resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing and missile damage. He gains +5% to this every 4 levels thereafter.
-  The barbarian rolls d12 for hit points instead of a fighter's d10.

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear full plate or plate mail armors.
-  Cannot specialize in weapons past normal specialization (two proficiency points.)~ []

@1045932 = ~It is yours. I give it to you without reservation or hesitation.~ []
@1045936 = ~Enjoy it as you will. Now, we are all but away. Gather what loot you can, for the sea will surely wash all bodies overboard once we hit open water.~ []
@1045951 = ~Search away, Captain! You'll not find any such object on me.~ []
@1046016 = ~Do not look so surprised. You must have expected to find me near your Imoen.~ [IRENIC36]
@1046019 = ~You are an afterthought. My concern is Imoen, not your imprisonment.~ []
@1046021 = ~Oh, but I'm not incarcerated here. No, I am the new coordinator, and you are in my care... once again.~ [IRENIC37]
@1046031 = ~You are intent on revenge or justice or whatever, but I don't really care. You can't do anything I don't wish you to.~ []

@1047805 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I found Mook at the docks, who reported to me seeing a man pass by several times, casing the place. When he appeared again, she challenged him... and he killed her. We defeated the man... or whatever he is... and he turned into mist before our eyes, cursing us as he fled.

No doubt that this would classify as an 'occurrence' that Aran might wish to know about in the morning.~ []
@1047806 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I informed Aran Linvail of the events on the docks, and he is even more concerned than before. His next task for me is to go to the top floor of the Five Flagons Inn in the Bridge District... there I will find two Shadow Thieves named Jaylos and Caehan who plan to defect to the rival guild.

Perhaps I can pretend to be another recruit, just as they are. If all goes as planned I might even fool their contact as well. Hopefully I will get the location of the rival guild's headquarters and then Aran can stop them from disrupting his people. Then we can get to the business of finding Imoen. He seems sincere in this.~ []
@1047814 = ~Here begins the tests of madness, of sanity and clarity. Presented with nonsense how will you proceed?~ []
@1047833 = ~The contact and your thieves are dead. A letter spoke of the Graveyard District.~ []
@1047837 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

While my information was of use to Aran, it appears he had a few other sources as well. The rival guild's leader, named Bodhi, is most certainly a vampire... and my investigation has confirmed that she and her undead minions can be found in the network of tombs beneath the Graveyard District.

I am to go to these tombs and destroy Bodhi and her guild. I am to receive assistance from a mage and his golem who will open an unmovable set of blue doors that are just north of a nest of spiders in the underground tomb. The final assault on these vampires will occur there, and Aran has given me four wooden stakes with which to put these vampires to their final rest.~ []
@1047838 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I have defeated the rival guild, full of vampires as it was, and have faced Bodhi. She claimed to know something of Imoen and seemed to be judging me in some manner before she retreated as a vampire bat. All that remains now is to return to Aran and tell him that the guild is gone, even if their leader remains unkilled. I will have questions for him as well.

One more troubling thing... Bodhi knew. She knew I am a child of Bhaal.~ []
@1047839 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I have completed the tasks Aran Linvail set out for me, and at last the location of Imoen has been revealed. This did not come, mind you, without some revelations.

The Shadow Thieves have been interested in me from the beginning. They were aware of my capture, but thought it nothing more than a simple kidnapping and none of their business. However, soon after that Bodhi appeared and their members started disappearing. They thought another guild was converting them, making a bid for control of the city's underground, and directed an attack against what they thought was the guild headquarters, Irenicus' dungeon below Waukeen's. 

They were totally unprepared for how strong Irenicus was. After the battle they set their sights on me, because I was the only thing that came out of that dungeon alive. Since I was of such interest to Irenicus they needed to know what I was up to. Once they realized that Irenicus was a threat to us both, they sought to aid me, while also aiding themselves. Their intentions were good, despite their selfish motive.

They believe that Irenicus is still very much a threat. Both Irenicus and Imoen have been taken to an island asylum called Spellhold where mages are imprisoned and studied. And yet it sounds doubtful that Irenicus has been so easily overcome. Bodhi and her rival guild are tied to him in some manner... and his purpose in studying both myself and Imoen is still unknown.

Imoen still remains in that place, however. The Shadow Thieves have arranged a ship to take me to the isle at no small expense, hoping in that retrieving Imoen I might rid them of their other problem, as well. Whatever happens, I am sure my biggest challenge yet awaits me on this isle.~ []
@1047846 = ~I will battle you to the last!~ []
@1047850 = ~I will arrange suitable punishment for your outburst. You will find that such obstinacy is painful, and that your path becomes more difficult.~ []
@1047863 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

In return for allowing me within their base, I am required to perform a small task for the Harpers. There is a small house in the center of the district, the home of a mage named Prebek. Within are supposed to be creatures of some kind... the result of someone's experiments. I am to kill these creatures and return.~ []
@1047864 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

I have been admitted to the Harper base... but Rylock warns me I must keep to the first floor. If I go to the second floor, I will be killed, and he implied that not even the Harpers could stop that from happening.~ []
@1047866 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

In conversation with the Harpers, it was mentioned that the second floor is protected by guardians of some nature... who would not recognize me as a Harper and were very dangerous.~ []
@1047869 = ~You have answered madness with inaccuracy, a dangerous thing to do. If you do not understand the ravings, best that you ignore them.~ []
@1047873 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

The guardians on the second floor do not seem to attack those who are wearing the harper amulets. I asked about Montaron, but all I got as a response was that 'those who defile Harper soil are forbidden to touch it. They are above the soil, that they might see it and know loss.' ... whatever that means.~ []
@1047888 = ~You have answered madness with inaccuracy, a dangerous thing to do. If you do not understand the ravings, best that you ignore them.~ []
@1047892 = ~Here, among the filth and bile of the mire where your hostility and foolishness has lead you, what do you see?~ []
@1047897 = ~Anyone could take what they wished from here. Better it was fenced in.~ []
@1047906 = ~Turnips! I see fine soil that could keep a man in tubers for life. Of course, I guess it's more for <CHARNAME> to say.~ []
@1047911 = ~Your voice does well enough. Wisdom and clarity speak well of sanity. Your path is somewhat easier now. Proceed.~ []
@1047912 = ~I offer civilized discourse and you counter with obstinacy. Unfortunate. Your path is the hard one.~ []
@1047913 = ~I offer civilized discourse and you counter with obstinacy. Unfortunate. Your path is the hard one.~ []
@1047918 = ~And if the market were to close? You show an unwillingness to change. Not good. The path will be a little harder.~ []
@1047919 = ~Far too dismissive. You show inflexibility. Not desirable. The path will be harder still.~ []
@1047923 = ~A simple task. You are quick of foot, and respond well. I applaud, though my approval means little.~ []
@1047930 = ~Who can say. It has been quite some time since the process has been refined. Really, I do not think you were intended to survive.~ []
@1047933 = ~You have failed to measure up to the standards I have applied. A final test then, to determine your worth.~ []
@1047934 = ~Defeat a creature of mind, the embodiment of control over the mental. Do this, and you shall perhaps see the light of day.~ []
@1047936 = ~This place is a momentary relapse. It has little to do with the testing. That you found your way here at all is interesting.~ []
@1047946 = ~I shall raze the entire building to this condition.~ []
@1047950 = ~The path is made easier, though not totally without hazard.~ []
@1047951 = ~Unproductive. You are not responding to these evaluations well at all. Would that I had a director here to study you properly.~ []
@1047952 = ~As it stands I can only discourage the thoughts. The path gets harder.~ []
@1047953 = ~I suppose this view is unavoidable, since I reinforce it by subjecting you to the tests in the first.~ []
@1047959 = ~Then we shall proceed to your evaluation.~ []
@1047960 = ~As you would.~ []
@1047961 = ~Are you through just yet? We must proceed to judgement.~ []
@1047970 = ~Save Jaheira from Baron Ployer's curse.

We have run into an old 'friend' of Jaheira's... a man named Baron Ployer who was a slaver that Jaheira ruined in the course of her Harper activities. The man has obviously been plotting his revenge, as he has created some manner of curse which he has laid on Jaheira... and which he claims will kill her.~ []
@1047980 = ~Summoned to the Harper Hold.

I have found Jaheira once again at the Harper Hold in Athkatla, and she has rejoined the party so that we may go together to present ourselves before the Harpers... for what reason, I still do not know.~ []
@1047982 = ~Summoned to the Harper Hold.

I presented myself before the Harpers at their base and discovered that I was there only to bolster the ambitions of a man by the name of Galvarey. Imprisoning the 'child of Bhaal' to restore the balance, as he claimed, would improve his position amongst the Harpers and bolster his chance of obtaining the position of Herald.
Jaheira had apparently brought me there to show Galvarey my true nature, but the decision had obviously already been made. She was upset, but could not take arms against her own kind. She fled as I fought against Galvarey and his fellow Harpers. I won... but Jaheira is now gone.~ []
@1047983 = ~Jaheira renounces her Harper status.

We have met with yet another Harper... this one, apparently, a former tutor of Jaheira's by the name of Dermin. He told Jaheira that he was sent to execute her for the deaths at the Harper Hold, and while he did not attack, Jaheira renounced her life as a Harper in anger over the injustice.~ []
@1047984 = ~Jaheira renounces her Harper status.

We have met with another Harper... this one, apparently, a former tutor of Jaheira's by the name of Dermin. He told Jaheira that he was sent to execute her for the deaths at the Harper Hold, and while he did not attack, Jaheira renounced her life as a Harper in anger over the injustice of it all. She was so wrapped up in the gravity of her decision that she blew up when I urged us to continue on and left for good. Perhaps just as well, considering all the trouble she brought me.~ []
@1047986 = ~The Harper plot revealed.

The plot with the Harpers has finally come clear... Galvarey was not a true Harper at all, simply an opportunist who used his position to gain power. Jaheira's former mentor was one of his compatriots, and both were counting on the fact that my own status as a child of Bhaal would make any accusations made against me believable.

One must wonder if the rest of the Harpers will continue their vendetta against Jaheira and I.~ []
@1047987 = ~Free Jan Jansen from prison.

Well, Jan Jansen's fine has been paid to the jailkeep... who was eager enough to see the garrulous gnome leave that he lent me 200 gp. He does expect to be paid back, though. I suppose the only thing to do now is to tell Jan he's free.~ []
@1047988 = ~Free Jan Jansen from prison.

The jailkeep who lent me the 200 gp toward Jan's fine has been paid back.~ []
@1047991 = ~Jan Jansen returns to his home in the slums.

I managed to get a garrulous con-artist gnome out of a jam with the local authorities, and he has offered to join my party in the future should I wish to track him down at his home in the slums. Selling turnips, he said... but somehow I doubt that.~ []
@1047996 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

The young girl, Jaella, has been cured of her illness... but even after all that, Jan's sweetheart Lissa decided to return to her cruel husband, Vaelag. Jan has sworn to take vengeance on the gnome if he ever hears of him hurting her again... but for now, he has rejoined my party.~ []
@1047997 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

The young girl, Jaella, has been cured of her illness... but even after all that, Jan's sweetheart Lissa decided to return to her cruel husband, Vaelag. Jan is broken-hearted, to say the least, and does not wish to remain at home... so he has rejoined my party once again.~ []
@1047998 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

The young girl, Jaella, has been cured... but even after all that, Lissa has agreed to return to her cruel husband, Vaelag. Jan is broken-hearted and wanted to return to my group, but I told him that it is best if he remains at home for a while. Jan will be available in the future, should I have need of him.~ []
@1048000 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

Lissa's daughter, Jaella, is dead... a cure could not be found in time to save her from her illness. Lissa has left Jan's home and the dispirited, sad gnome seems more than willing to rejoin the party just to be away from there.~ []
@1048001 = ~Yoshimo escapes the dungeon on his own.

I met a thief in this dark place who named himself Yoshimo. I didn't trust him enough to take him with me, but he did say that if I get out of this dungeon (as does he), that I should try and find him, perhaps at the closest tavern.~ []
@1048012 = ~Keldorn returns to his wife and family.

After discovering that his wife had taken up with another man during his long absences, Keldorn has come to the conclusion that he is to blame... and I have urged him to leave my companionship and attempt a reconciliation with her. I wonder if I shall see him again?~ []
@1048013 = ~Keldorn dies defending Sir William.

Keldorn's odd sense of justice and honor forced him to defend Sir William, the very man whom his own wife has been betraying him with. Now, the Lady Maria is not only an adulteress, but a widow as well.~ []
@1048015 = ~Keldorn returns to his wife and family.

After discovering that his wife, Maria, had taken up with another man during his long absences, Keldorn decided that it was he who was at fault... and sought a reconciliation. Keldorn promised to resign from the Order, and I urged him to spend a day with his family, rebuilding their relationship... after which Keldorn told me that I could find him at his estate once again.~ []
@1048016 = ~Keldorn returns to his wife and family.

After discovering that his wife, Maria, had taken up with another man during his long absences, Keldorn came to the decision that it was he who was to blame. He has reconciled with his wife, promising that his mission with me shall be his last and that after he returns he shall resign from the Order... a promise which she has accepted.~ []
@1048017 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn's wife had betrayed him by spending time with another man during his absences... and while he might feel otherwise, the only proper thing for Keldorn to do was to bring both her and her lover to justice.~ []
@1048018 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

@1048516 = ~Ah, yes, the old puzzle-box trick. Ma Jensen used to hide the keys to the breadbox the same way, not that it ever stopped us.

@1048529 = ~Well... I've heard of this Lord Jierdan, <CHARNAME>, if it's any help. He has the coin to back up his offer. He's not reputed to be the nicest noble in Amn, but then who is?~ []
@1048533 = ~I... I don't know, Jaheira, I've heard about this Lord Jierdan. He's brutal; it's not like him to be so protective of his people. I don't like the sound of this.~ []

@1048549 = ~No, don't leave.~ []
@1048564 = ~<CHARNAME>, you should think on this for a moment. This is the only one who can attest to our innocence. I doubt the Order will believe our story without his aid.~ []

@1048635 = ~I am not certain I would find your wares palatable regardless. I suspect they are ill-got in origin.~ []
@1048643 = ~Hah! A liar exposed for the fraud that he is! To use such an excuse as an ill mother only to be revealed... it sickens my stomach to witness such base cunning.~ []
@1048652 = ~No doubt you are deserving of your punishment, though this place is probably far emptier than it should be...~ []

The life of a drunkard lies in the balance as <CHARNAME> and his band of merry adventurers strive to retrieve fenced stolen musical goods from the depths of the sewers! The passion! The excitement!

@1049160 = ~I have spoken with... the Spirit. I want to become a druid, I guess. It said that I will protect the Grove when you have moved on... that I have a destiny, here.~ []
@1049161 = ~I'm on my way, but you had better come through with your part of the bargain.~ []
@1049168 = ~We knew of your capture almost as soon as it happened. Very little occurs in this city that we are not aware of.~ []

@1049179 = ~The Grove senses a dark destiny ahead of you, with much danger both moral and physical. For now your task is done in the Grove.~ []
@1049183 = ~We had to be sure. We could not let an enemy into the guild when we are so weakened. In truth, your gold was much needed as well.~ []
@1049185 = ~We thought you could lead us to him, and you can. You seek Imoen and Irenicus, and we seek answers. They were taken to the same place, you see.~ []
@1049190 = ~Let an old man gripe, son.~ []
@1049199 = ~Or we have mistakenly wandered amidst the dirty and reprehensible.~ []

@1049396 = ~Gerg not ready to die in stinkhole like this! I leave!~ []

@1049502 = ~I don't know. Regardless, we have to get back what Irenicus took from us.~ []

@1049571 = ~Very well. I don't mean to be rude. Things are not done with such abruptness and selfishness in our town. Thank you and goodbye.~ []
@1049578 = ~As you will. In this area, you will have to find a sun gem to pass one of the shadow doors. Be careful! Once you take it off of the altar, its light will no longer protect you from the shadows.~ []
@1049588 = ~We can't just leave him. Well, we should at least find who he's talking about or... or find him some help? Please, <CHARNAME>? We can't just let someone die...~ []
@1049604 = ~A fate, as they say, worse than death, and one that has not gone unnoticed by your comrades.~ []

The garrison might be just as likely to re-bury the man to avoid having to write up a report about it. It happened to my cousin Biffle, once, you know. Some errant mage had cast an Earthquake spell and opened up a chasm that poor Biffle had fallen into. A terrible sight to behold, especially since his entire tray of Aunt Gertie's turnip muffins flew into the chasm with him. She had been hoping to win the local muffin baking contest, and we were all bereaved for weeks that Gertie hadn't gotten her due. She'd been baking for weeks, you know. Why she'd given the tray to Biffle no one could ever figure out... he was always suffering from one kind of bad luck or another, you'd have thought he'd offended the gods. Tsk. Hmmm... where was I?~ []

@1050359 = ~I am indebted to you. Perhaps we might be of use to each other. I had great plans before I was so rudely interrupted.~ []

@1050472 = ~That is sufficient. I thank you for your generosity.~ []
@1050475 = ~And I must refuse your request. I have been more than reasonable, and yet you demand more. What I have given will suffice or we will face each other in battle.~ []
@1050478 = ~It is enough.~ []

@1050529 = ~You are confused... perhaps mad. Calm yourself or you will come to harm.~ []
@1050535 = ~I'm glad to hear it. The fact of the matter is, Logan's lily-footing ways will fail. I wonder if the fool even wants to stop the mad druids!~ []

@1050575 = ~It... it was. I thank you for you mercy. Here, please take this as payment. It is quite valuable, but I won't be needing it. I'm getting out of here and out of adventuring.~ []
@1050582 = ~I will not give you anything, and I will not be imprisoned again!~ []
@1050583 = ~And what is your place? To stand at the fore and fling accusations? I have survived more self-righteous rivvin than you, and done far less harm!~ []

@1050627 = ~I demand to know your intent! Where is the group I traveled with! Speak!~ []
@1050631 = ~We must decide whether we are the masters of nature or slaves to it. I, for one, do not intend to be a slave. There is only one way to handle a situation such as this.~ []

@1050669 = ~Quickly, <CHARNAME>, these poor inmates might hurt themselves if we don't give them direction.~ []
@1050670 = ~Boo is worried that these inmates will harm themselves, <CHARNAME>. We should see that they are safe and make sure they each have a hamster of their own.~ []
@1050671 = ~That last part was my idea.~ []
@1050675 = ~Oh my, this reminds me of the last Jansen family reunion -being the *last* one for reasons that I'm sure will become clear- back on the eve of the Year of Shadows, when gods walked and magic went wild. Cousin Bungle spiked the turnip tea at the end of a particularly festive jig and half the grandparents got soused enough to storm a nearby ogre camp. You haven't seen chaos until you've been on the receiving end of twenty drunken geriatric goblinstickers, all demanding gems and whatever ale might be on hand, I tell you.~ []
@1050679 = ~A wise tactic to split an opponent's force with magic. Your kind are tricky adversaries, Drow. I will not fall victim to the same again.~ []

@1050693 = ~Coward... you will die!~ []
@1050694 = ~Hmph. I misjudged you, coward. Run along then and play by Logan's lily-livered rules. When I come to power you shall no longer be welcome in Trademeet.~ []

@1050709 = ~You would attack me for no reason? Even in this place you must be especially reprehensible.~ []
@1050713 = ~You'll pay something or you'll die. It's that simple.~ []
@1050714 = ~Fine, get out of here then.~ []
@1050726 = ~I especially did not expect to meet such friendly people in the form of Drow. Still, actions speak loudest and you have proven to be my friend.~ []

The spells stored in the sequencer are cast as any other spell and can be accessed through the special abilities button on the main screen. It is important to note that when you choose the spells to be stored in the trigger, they will disappear from the ones you have memorized. However, the trigger will last until used so the caster may rest and gain those spells back. The main use for this spell would be to allow the caster to release multiple spells upon a target very quickly in combat without the possibility of being interrupted.~ []
@1055403 = ~Katana +2
It is no simple deed to enchant a katana. Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword. Improving it further usually requires a sacrifice; perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into his sword. The wielder of an enchanted katana such as this one must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried the blade into battle. Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

@1055459 = ~Intrigue with Jarlaxle

Lies again, of course. The gems Jarlaxle wished stolen did not contain the souls of his men, whom he never risked by attacking the Lich to begin with. The gems were actually valuable artifacts belonging to House Jae'llat, of which the Lich was an ally. Jarlaxle concocted this whole affair for his original goal of retribution against the House that failed to pay him. I may have gained the means to enter two Drow dwellings, but this chicanery makes my head spin. The Rope will get me back to where I should be.~ []
@1055488 = ~You may choose <number> spells to put in your spell book. These will be the spells that your character currently has the ability to cast.~ []
@1055499 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: A helpful druid.

I met with a Druid patrolling around the grove. He let slip that a Shadow Druid named Faldorn was controlling the area with an iron fist. He seemed reluctant to harm me, though he also suggested that others would not be as hesitant.~ []
@1055500 = ~Some of the others have all but joined her as Shadow Druids as well. She is not the only enemy now. I must go. I cannot be seen with outsiders.~ []
@1055501 = ~She has seduced quite a few with her Shadow Druid wiles. Perhaps he could challenge her... she seems subject to the old ways even as she poisons our intentions.~ []
@1055506 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: The Shadow Druid.

I have met with Faldorn, the Shadow Druid in control of the grove. She has bonded with the land, and the only way to unseat her from power is for another druid to challenge her in one on one combat.~ []
@1055530 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: Thieves among thieves.

I have been told that one of Kretor's pickpockets has been stealing from the guild. None of the four possible culprits claim to know who has done it. I have decided to kill them all. I will not have dishonest thieves under me. Kretor can replace them.~ []
@1055532 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: Thieves among thieves.

I have been told that one of Kretor's pickpockets has been stealing from the guild. None of the four possible culprits claim to know who has done it. I have decided to kill one of them. With luck I'll get the right one. If not, I'm sure the fear will straighten the others out.~ []
@1055533 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: Thieves among thieves.

It would seem that I chose the right thief to kill. Kretor reports that the stealing of guild funds has stopped. A lucky choice indeed.~ []
@1055538 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: the guild has failed.

My thieves will no longer work with me unless I have the support of the main Shadow Thief guild. They suggested that I ask Renal Bloodscalp to reinstate me.~ []
@1055542 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: business as usual.

I must remember to check in at my thieves' guild every 5 days or so. I must continue to check on my thieves and also pay the quotamaster.~ []
@1055543 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: The price of failure.

It appears that Renal will allow me to continue as master of my own guild branch, but it will cost me to do so.~ []
@1055545 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: First test.

I have been given my first test as a member of the Most Noble Order. I am to go to the furthest reaches of the Umar Hills where I will find a besieged group of knights. I am to do what I must to save them. I have very little time and must leave immediately.~ []
@1055546 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties:

I have failed in my service as a member of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. My actions or lack thereof have caused serious damage, unbefitting a paladin. I have been removed from the Order, the honor that was granted has been stripped.~ []
@1055549 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A good person has fallen.

I saved two of those I was sent to rescue, but the odds were against the third. The Order will survive, but that is small consolation to those that knew the victim. It is unfortunate, and very bad for morale.~ []
@1055551 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A Baron's request.

Baron Metrich wishes a number of squatters removed, and has cited recent violence against his men as just cause for such action. I must go to the neutral meeting place, a tavern in the Umar Hills, in the village of Imnesvale. I must restore order and bring favor on our name.~ []
@1055553 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A fitting end.

The Order will stand by my actions with the Baron I was sent to appease. His claims were lies, such that I could not allow him to continue.~ []
@1055554 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A child in distress.

The Morningale family has been slaughtered for their part in combating slavery. I am to go to a safehouse where Tyrianna has been secreted away. I am to guard her until her godparent arrives to take her to Baldur's Gate. Hurgis Baltezan will be there as soon as he can.~ []
@1055556 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A moral victory.

Tyrianna is alive and well, thanks to me being able to detect the evil that was about to be perpetrated. The real Hurgis collected her as he said he would, confirming my suspicion that a fake Hurgis had been sent in his place to begin with. I have now been given leave to pursue my own goals. The Order will contact me if further service is required.~ []
@1055557 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: doesn't look like squatters.

I have spoken with Brunson, one of the supposed squatters that I am to oust. He suggested that I go out of my way to speak with some of the others involved in this situation.~ []
@1055562 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: Baron not what he seems?

The Baron is well pleased with the bloody measures I have taken. I am not so sure, however, that the Baron has accurately represented himself. Just now his aide called the 'squatters' simple farmers. Still, we have the Baron's favor now.~ []
@1055571 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should ignore his wife's infidelity. His marriage will continue despite this simple indiscretion.~ []
@1055572 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should kill his wife for her infidelity. Her crime is unforgivable.~ []
@1055573 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should remind his wife of her duty to their vows. She will understand that duty is all-important.~ []
@1055577 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was well served. 

Stressing self-sacrifice for the love of another was in the true spirit of the teachings of Lathander, and Glinden and his wife have benefited. I have served the church well.~ []
@1055578 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was not served. 

I have not done well in the eyes of Lathander. I should have stressed that Glinden adopt a more self-sacrificing love for his wife. Instead, they are unhappy and church doctrine is unsatisfied.~ []
@1055579 = ~Cleric Stronghold: My church has rejected me. 

My actions were so contrary to church teachings that I have been cast out. I no longer have the sanctuary I was granted.~ []
@1055580 = ~The prophecy of Sekolah

Taken down into a city far below the ocean surface by the Sahuagin, I was greeted by a High Priestess of the shark god Sekolah and told that I was intended for some higher purpose that Sekolah had foretold. Not one to be used, I refused their 'hospitality'... I would rather fight my way back to the surface, if need be.~ []
@1055584 = ~Cleric Stronghold: a troubled killer.

Ti'Vael came to me seeking wisdom. He had killed a man in what looked like a duel, but he claims he actually murdered the man because of the insults he hurled. I told him to turn himself in.~ []
@1055593 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is well pleased.

While prison may not be the happiest of places, Ti'Vael's spirit will flourish in the end. He had a duty to a greater law, and I advised him properly.~ []
@1055594 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is mostly satisfied.

Events with Ti'Vael could have been handled better. Remember the greater duty, and do not surrender to sentiment.~ []
@1055595 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A faithless heretic. 

Rania came to me to confess a lack of faith. I killed her for it.~ []
@1055596 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A crisis of faith. 

Rania came to me to confess a lack of faith. I stressed the duty that she should have to the church. She seemed unresponsive.~ []
@1055598 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A crisis of faith.

Rania came to me to confess a lack of faith. I expelled her from the church. There is no place here for unbelievers.~ []
@1055599 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander prefers empathy.

The Morninglord is appreciative of the importance of duty, but a more compassionate front would have served poor Rania better.~ []
@1055600 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander is pleased.

The compassionate way that I advised Rania has garnered me some respect among my peers. The Morninglord is well pleased.~ []
@1055601 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander is disappointed. 

I was far too harsh on poor Rania. The Morninglord would have me act more compassionate to those in distress.~ []
@1055602 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is pleased.

Rania is a regrettable loss, but if her faith could not stand up to the pressures of duty, her loss was necessary.~ []
@1055603 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is not pleased.

I was too lenient on Rania and her weakened faith. Duty should have been better stressed. If she could not stand up to such, she is not worthy of Helm.~ []
@1055606 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Talos was well served.

My actions with Rania have been praised, though death would have been a better reward for her questioning.~ []
@1055610 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A challenge.

Cotirso's fate was his own, and the church has accepted that he took his life into his hands when he challenged me.~ []
@1055612 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Cotirso is pacified.

Lathander viewed my lack of offense against Cotirso as a good example of restraint, though I should not have goaded him by threatening to take the matter up with our superiors. A calm front would accomplish more.~ []
@1055613 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Cotirso is pacified.

Helm would rather have had me accept Cotirso's challenge, although everything has worked out regardless.~ []
@1055614 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Cotirso is removed.

Helm is satisfied that Cotirso took his life into his hands when he challenged me. I had no choice but to accept and respond as I must.~ []
@1055618 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Halting the Talon War.

I have served the greater law and pacified both the Talons and the followers of the Morninglord. My service to Helm has been recognized as invaluable. For now I have been released from further service as a boon for all that I have done so far. I await to be called if need be.~ []
@1055619 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A strong offense. 

I have been directed to bring the fury of the Morninglord to bear upon the house of Talos. They were to attack the Dawnbringer's home, and we cannot allow it. I am to enter the den of the enemy and wreak horrible justice. This is my holy crusade.~ []
@1055620 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A terrible toll. 

My vengeance has been brought down upon the house of Talos. They have been wiped out for now, and the house of the Morninglord will see the dawn in peace. I have been given time to... recover from my efforts, though I eagerly await a future call to service.~ []
@1055621 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A terrible toll avoided. 

I have succeeded in appeasing the Lathander faithful, such that they will not march on their enemy this night. Further bloodshed has been avoided.~ []
@1055622 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A terrible toll to come. 

I have failed to appease the followers of Lathander. They march against Talos in anger tonight. While they may succeed this day, I can only see escalation on the horizon.~ []
@1055623 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A glorious battle to come!

I have been given the blessing of Talos, and the sacred duty to deliver his wrath! The Lathander temple will be cleansed tonight! My wrath shall be terrible and beautiful!~ []
@1055626 = ~Mage Stronghold: The Solamnic Knights.

I asked the Cowled Wizard Teos what he would do about the Solamnic Knights brought here in the sphere from their own home plane. He suggested that I kill them. On the useful side, he did mention that Ribald at the Adventurers' Mart might have insight into unique situations such as this. Alternately, I could petition the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. They know how to deal with paladins and such.~ []
@1055627 = ~Mage Stronghold: I have apprentices.

Teos has brought me three young mages that I am to guide through study. Teos was not too thrilled, but I will make good use of the situation, I am sure.~ []
@1055628 = ~Mage Stronghold: Teos unmoved.

Teos did not seem too concerned that my apprentices have all met unfortunate deaths in my service. Business as usual, I guess, though I will miss the chance to shape some young minds in my image.~ []
@1055629 = ~Mage Stronghold: Ambush!

Teos had not summoned me to the sphere. It was an ambush to get us both. We were attacked by a strange assailant. He screamed about the 'glory of Argrim.'~ []
@1055630 = ~Mage Stronghold: Fanatic assassination.

Teos has given me a new task. I am to dispatch one Lord Ketlaar Argrim. He is an anti-magic fanatic, and wants us all confined or killed. I am to use a special rune of imprisonment on him so that he will not be a martyr. He will simply disappear. Ketlaar can be found at the Crooked Crane near the city gates.~ []
@1055632 = ~Mage Stronghold: Free at last.

I have been released from service to the Cowled Wizards. I did as they asked to the best of my ability, facing off against Lord Ketlar and whatnot, so now I have unfettered use of the Planar Sphere. A painfully obvious base of operations, but it will have to do.~ []
@1055633 = ~Mage Stronghold: Apprentice crap.

Apparently those apprentices that were dumped on me were supposed to take instruction and make what I directed. I have no time to care, so I just cut them loose. Let's see what they can do on their own. Might be a bit dangerous, but they have to learn sometime, right?~ []
@1055634 = ~Mage Stronghold: Young minds to mold.

The apprentices have given me a unique opportunity. I am to give them instruction, guiding their learning, and they will attempt to make me magical items. Each week they will display their results as they work on their talents. Already it sounds as though the range of items is quite broad. I look forward to seeing what they can do.~ []
@1055635 = ~Mage Stronghold: A messenger from Teos?

A messenger approached me to say that I should return to the Planar Sphere at once. Teos apparently awaits there with urgent news.~ []
@1055636 = ~Mage Stronghold: Graduation was great.

It was a great opportunity to see my apprentices graduating from their studies. They seemed genuinely appreciative, and I thanked them for their kind words. I hope they fare well, despite the Cowled Wizards lording over them. I look forward to seeing what they can do...~ []
@1055637 = ~Mage Stronghold: Graduation was somber.

I tried to keep a smile during the ceremony. It is good to see the young making their own way in the world. It's just a pity that they couldn't all have lived to see this day. Not that life under the yoke of the Cowled Wizards would have been all that great, but it would have been interesting. Oh well. I guess you can only wish well who you can, and say a word in memorandum for the rest.~ []
@1055638 = ~Mage Stronghold: Attacking the fanatic.

I have encountered Lord Ketlaar. There really is no talking to him. He is blind to everything, save hatred of magic.~ []
@1055640 = ~Mage Stronghold: Ribald can free the Knights.

Ribald in the adventurers' mart has the means to send the knights home, but he requires 9,000 gold.~ []
@1055641 = ~Mage Stronghold: I have paid for the Knights.

Ribald has taken 9,000 gold and has promised to send a mage to the sphere and teleport the knights home. At these prices, she had better show up!~ []
@1055642 = ~Mage Stronghold: The Knights at the Order.

I have spoken with the Prelate of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. He has said that the Solamnic Knights can stay as with them as honored guests. It's a viable alternative if they can't get home another way.~ []
@1055643 = ~Mage Stronghold: A request for help.

The Solamnic Knights that were trapped in the Sphere and brought to this plane have asked that I try and find a way for them to get home. I will look into it.~ []
@1055646 = ~Drizzt, I'm so glad you could come.~ []
@1055651 = ~Cannot equip a ranged weapon in your off hand.~ []
@1055653 = ~I have seen the like of this place before all too closely. It is where they house those that are different, where the misunderstood are forgotten...~ []
@1055666 = ~Pretties, you say? Do you mean... gems? Have you any faculties left? Can you remember?~
@1055668 = ~This young minstrel has lost his wits and his songs? Minds are common enough, but tunes of merit are few and far between.~ []
@1055670 = ~Hmph. I would respond to yer comment with me axe if the mere thought of movin' didn't make me stomach roll. Begone, and count yerself lucky this time!~ []
@1055671 = ~Rest, child. None of this group shall harm you.~ []
@1055677 = ~Okay, I'm not quite so concerned about this little freak. Rule as you will, little tyrant, just as long as it is from a cell.~ []
@1055680 = ~Yes! Such fire and conviction! A pity there are no actual enemies to warrant the screaming, but good show anyway. Boo applauds!~ []
@1055714 = ~CHAPTER FOUR

Bodhi was as good as her word and you are quickly under sail, the flamboyant Saemon Havarian at the helm. The journey is uneventful, and if there were other ships on the same course they must have kept a discreet distance. You make good time, and soon there is a sizable island on the horizon. It might have been considered a pleasant place, but a grim shadow extends the length of it. The asylum, Spellhold, looms from a cliff side.~ [CHAPT04B]
@1055723 = ~Would that I had a healing touch that could help this man. I think his madness is of his own making though.~ []
@1055725 = ~I do believe that he probably looked too far into the business of the gods. It was not his place to do so.~ []
@1055734 = ~I see... a walking corpse... he speaks... to a pillar of skulls? See, it is madness!~ []
@1055747 = ~I am loath to listen too closely to the words of the human, but his advice may be wise. Let us at least see if these mad wizards can be released... and harnessed.~
@1055748 = ~You're just not all there, are you.~ []
@1055749 = ~All bluster and balderdash, ain't ya. Uncle Chester Bellowsbreath was like that too, talking himself so big that you'd swear he was ten feet tall, which was not too far off considering he had a strange disorder stemming from an obscenity hurled at a passing wizard one drunken eve in Waterdeep. Stomp and pomp all ye wish, but it would do you well to take the simple advice of never telling Khelben Blackstaff to "put a shine on that thing and stop being so darned pompous with yer dark-cornered mysteriosity," and if you do, don't punctuate it with a rotten turnip at high velocity.~ []
@1055752 = ~Ah...~ []
@1055753 = ~Tiax has lost his place! The indignity!~ []
@1055758 = ~Okay, that does it. I'm all for just leaving the halfling here when we go. Who's with me on that?~ []
@1055761 = ~Hmph. That's putting it mildly. (Godhood should be solely reserved for those with the proper destiny and mental endurance. Me, for instance!)~ []
@1055775 = ~Hrmph!~ []
@1055782 = ~The imp has failed to string out his usual longwinded story. Praise be, the end must be comin'.~ []
@1055785 = ~His ramblings have no meaning. He is raging at enemies long since gone.~ []
@1055796 = ~Oh, sure, we're his best friends now that we're going to go and steal him a brand new ship and everything. And once we gotten it for him, you think he'll still be so nice? Reminds me of my cousin Beauregarde. The most selfish gnome you've ever seen, he wouldn't give you a spare turnip for anything. Well, okay there was that one time he gave a turnip to Uncle Scratchy, but Uncle Scratchy had him held over a vat of boiling ---~ []
@1055800 = ~Aha! Something from my mother's mother's father! A real whiz around pots and pans. Wait, I said that wrong.~ []
@1055802 = ~Well, fine. I just wanted to point out that Beauregarde was eaten by a griffon that was terrorizing the hillside and he gave the beast fatal indigestion. So sometimes even the most selfish of us can still give.~ []
@1055808 = ~What now? Move along, I've rather strained my voice.~ [PPDRAD11]
@1055810 = ~It is a weakness on her part. A superior mind could handle such a gift.~ []
@1055814 = ~(Sigh. It's aggravation like this that will eventually cause me to fireball the entire party as they sleep. Yes indeed, everyone peaceful and quiet and then FOOM!)~ []
@1055843 = ~Negative Plane Protection (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell confers upon the target partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as vampires), as well as from certain weapons and spells which drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy plane, offsetting the effects of a negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is shielded against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell, suffering only normal hit point damage. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy plane.~ []
@1055845 = ~Lesser Restoration (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the target is raised, reversing any previous level drain which may have occurred. The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, who likely will require rest immediately afterwards.~ []
@1055864 = ~This... this is the Underdark. Oh, I do not want to be here, I don't! This place is death for my people! I... I feel as if I'm going to suffocate here!~ [AERIEB7]

@1055885 = ~Could I be healed instead?~ []
@1055886 = ~So I am in my homeland once again. Already I feel how unwelcome it has become. My eyes are no longer used to its darkness and my senses to the hint of the threat around every corner.~ [VICONIB5]
@1055889 = ~A most underhanded maneuver, <CHARNAME>. Although I am sure it is no less than Phaere might have planned for us. There is an ironic justice in this, no?~ []
@1055895 = ~So... a war? Open battle between the Drow and the surface has not occurred in... eons. With a greater demon to back them... I truly wonder why Irenicus would do this.~ []
@1055897 = ~Ha! I don't know his words all that well, but I do respect those willing to risk insulting strangers.~ []
@1055920 = ~Do you see, <CHARNAME>? See the fear in his eyes? You now enjoy the respect the Drow have earned.~ []

@1055946 = ~Careful, Aerie, we must maintain the illusion that we are who we seem.~ []
@1055950 = ~As a drow on the surface, he should expect such treatment. If I tracked down every rivvil who has wronged me, I would end up doing little else.~ []

@1055995 = ~Yet, you had a key, a Rogue Stone. What did you hope to accomplish by trespassing in my chamber?~ []

I tell you, he got so involved in the tasting that he fell into the keg up to his ankles the wrong way around, and had to breathe through the spigot for three hours lest he drown in a watery tomb of his own making. Helpful Aunt Tildeberry came in later for a late night snifter and tried to unclog the spout with a hairpin, and you can imagine the fuss that emerged from that mess.

I spoke with Goldander Blackenrock, Lord of the svirfneblin village. His pompous title revealed the shallow nature of his needs. He spoke of a means that I might enter the Drow city, by enlisting the aid of Adalon, a powerful creature that holds court at the base of the great staircase. Goldander wanted me to first perform a service for his village, defeating some creature that they had unearthed, and he offered to grant me access to Adalon as reward, giving me a glow stone or some such, so that I could pass through the darkness that protects her lair. I cut out the middleman and killed the lot of them.~ []

He was, however, a little concerned that I had already pickpocketed the light gem that he had intended to give me. Oh well, as long as I got it.~ []
@1057864 = ~Captured by Mind Flayers!

I could trust the Githyanki, but only to a point. Simyaz and his group are leaving me to fend for myself, and I will have to find my own means of escape. They left after again chastising me for the theft of their Silver Sword, the weapon I got from Saemon Havarian. Lacking the teleportational abilities of the Githyanki I could not follow when they left, and must now face the wrath of the illithid city on my own.~ []
@1057866 = ~Captured by Mind Flayers.

I met the Githyanki again. I found them resting in a cavern, quite surprised to see that I had lived through the illithid city. I registered my displeasure by making them pay for their treachery with blood.~ []

@1057914 = ~The Elven city requires my aid.

Elhan has requested my service none too subtly. To reach Irenicus I must first help the elves gain entry to their own city, Suldanessellar. Irenicus has hidden it using illusionary magics of some sort that defy dispelling. If we are to regain access, I have to retrieve the Rhynn Lanthorn, an artifact lantern that is attuned to the elven nation. Elhan believes that someone powerful that follows Irenicus stole it from the desecrated elven temple, and I have a very clear idea just who that might be. I will not receive help from the elves in tracking her, even though I am certain I am familiar with her old stomping ground. Elhan has advised that he cannot follow with his battalions for risk of causing an even larger incident, this time with paranoid human forces. He suggested that I seek out allies among the groups I have already met within human territories.~ []

The Rhynn Lanthorn will now guide us into Suldanessellar. The majority of Elhan's elves will have to remain here to rout the Drow, meaning I will be left to deal with Irenicus and whatever he has unleashed upon the city. Elhan has still not revealed the origins of Irenicus' hatred towards the elves, and has shed little light on why he refers to the mage as 'the Exile', saying only that the crime was great, the punishment greater. Irenicus must have done something especially abhorrent to the elves. Once in the city I will see if the high priestess Demin has any more information, if the city is intact at all.~ []

@1060102 = ~Katana +3
It is no simple deed to enchant a katana. Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword. Improving it further usually requires a sacrifice; perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into his sword. The wielder of an enchanted katana such as this one must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried the blade into battle. Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

This is the true name that the dwarven weaponsmith, Silverblade, gave to the weapon he intended to create for his son. Alas, his son died before the weapon was ever completed, but here it stands complete, forged from the combined magic of the original hammer with the Gauntlets of Ogre Power and a Girdle of Frost Giant Strength. Crom Faeyr gifts its users with all the powers of the original Hammer of Thunderbolts, in addition to enormous strength and the ability to kill golems, ettins and trolls in one blow.

@1060866 = ~Long Sword: The Equalizer
The age of this sword is such that its true origin has been lost to time, but markings hint that it was possibly forged by those in the service of Helm. Also called the "Sword of Neutrality," it seems designed to seek and terminate extremism, to shift the universe closer to harmonious equilibrium. The further the orientation of a target from true balance, the more potent the damage they suffer.

It is said that Gesen was prepared to retire from his craft after selling the invaluable weapon, only to have the bow wrested from his grasp by a thief who used it to end Gesen's own life. This bow also bestows protection from electricity upon its user.

@1060877 = ~Mace of Disruption +2
This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead. Any undead creature hit by it not only feels the sting of the weapon, but also has a chance of being blasted from existence. There are legends that speak of a priest so holy that a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians. Now that the mace has been coated with illithium, it is even more potent, conferring to its user immunity to the life-draining powers of the more potent undead.

Perhaps the strange circumstances of his death preserved this blade, as it would otherwise have lost its form when his will no longer shaped it.

The evil is close to breaking the seals of its prison and becoming free. The Knights would enter the Keep and perform a ritual to fix those seals, but cannot as they are too weak to bypass the traps and monsters within.

The Knights would enter the Keep and perform a ritual to fix those seals, but cannot as they are too weak to bypass the traps and monsters within.

I have accepted the task of entering the Keep and fixing the seal that keeps this evil imprisoned. It may be a long task... the Keep is large and quite dangerous... but Odren says there is still some time before the remaining seals are broken.

I performed the ritual to re-seal his prison... and tricked the demon into allowing me to leave the prison to lure Odren and the Knights within. I did not... Demogorgon remains imprisoned and Odren has left with the Knights to atone for their abandonment of their calling in trying to manipulate me.~ []

@1062946 = ~I shall read the scroll, then... I trust you less than anything else.~ []

@1062966 = ~Greetings, puny one. I am Saladrex. I assumed the disturbance I heard earlier was another attack by the mind flayers, but I see now that you must have been the cause. It is nice to see a new mouse stumble into my lair.~ [GORDRA07]
@1062972 = ~Puny one? Mouse? I am <GABBER> - a hero of great renown! Try to be civil, or I shall have to teach you some manners.~ []
@1062973 = ~I don't trust you... I'm going to read the scroll.~ []
@1062976 = ~You get the impression of a definite promise from this being. If revenge is not enough, once the Imprisoned One is free it will have power to offer whatever you wish. Images of wealth and magic... as well as an offer of information on your godly heritage and its true powers...~ []
@1062978 = ~I don't trust you... I'm going to read the scroll.~ []
@1062980 = ~None of these things interest me... but neither does helping the Knights. I'm leaving.~ []
@1062981 = ~The presence withdraws from your mind, watching you warily... but says nothing.~ []
@1062982 = ~A series of images take you a moment to understand. The Imprisoned One wishes you to go to the leader of the Knights... tell him that you have destroyed it. He will wish to enter the Keep to confirm this. The Imprisoned One will kill him... and with his death it shall be free at long last. The false Helmites will be destroyed and justice shall be done.~ []
@1062984 = ~No... I will not be manipulated by you. I will read the scroll and be done with it.~ []
@1062985 = ~No, I will not take part in your plan. Show yourself, whatever you are... I shall destroy you here and now.~ []
@1062987 = ~Watcher's Keep

I have encountered the Imprisoned One after opening the final seal and listened to its story of false imprisonment by the Knights of the Vigil and its offer of revenge and reward for its freedom. According to it, the Knights had planned for me to be sealed up in this place along with the Imprisoned One... something that strikes me as having the ring of truth. In order to free the Imprisoned One, I will have to go to Odren and tell him that the Imprisoned One is dead... Odren will investigate and the Imprisoned One will kill him.~ []
@1062988 = ~Feelings of faint surprise creep through your mind. The presence asks if you no longer intend to read the scroll... with clear hope it suggests that perhaps now you are willing to act against the false Helmites?~ []
@1063004 = ~No, not really. I just want to fight.~ []
@1063006 = ~Fine. Tell me, Saladrex:  how did you ever end up in a place like this?~ []
@1063010 = ~A dragon with an ego - what a shock. Very well. How did you end up in this dungeon, oh most wondrous of lizards?~ []
@1063011 = ~My story is truly a grand tale! Of course, every story about me is going to be grand simply by virtue of the main character.~ [GORDRA11]
@1063012 = ~The currents in the room waver as feelings of resentment laced with amusement wash over you. You interpret the sensations as the Imprisoned One's congratulations... the seals are renewed. It tells you to attempt to exit, now... and to come back to it when you fail.~ []
@1063026 = ~I have only been here a few years, an insignificant time for a dragon. But I choose to remain for a number of reasons. For one, I find the antics of Carston and the other lesser creatures on this level amusing.~ []
@1063029 = ~Images flow through your mind as the presence considers. It offers that there are two ways to exit. The first is to listen to its offer. The second is to destroy it... without the Imprisoned One, the presence imagines that the prison would be once again open. Behind this feeling is muffled amusement.~ []
@1063033 = ~The presence is now far more intent, hope seizing upon opportunity. You have been deceived, you are told... you know that now. Deceived by the unworthy false Helmites, just as they imprisoned it. It wishes to be free... and it also wishes revenge.~ []
@1063035 = ~More images flood in, telling you that the Imprisoned One has been slowly marshaling its power to free itself... a process that would take an eon all told. But it has enough power now to open the smallest of holes in the seal... not enough for it, but enough for you.~ []
@1063037 = ~Pleased images swirl in your mind, telling you to go to the Knights of the Vigil and tell their leader that the Imprisoned One is destroyed. Then it may have its revenge. With his death, it will be free... and it will reward you handsomely. Indeed... various fleeting images hint to you that it has knowledge of how to unlock the powers of Bhaal within you.~ []
@1063038 = ~I don't like the implication in that look you give me when you mention thieves.~ []
@1063040 = ~Perhaps I am paranoid, <GABBER>. The Machine of Lum the Mad has had some small effect on all the creatures trapped in here. We sometimes behave irrationally.~ []
@1063045 = ~The presence is pleased and hopeful that you will keep your word. An image forms in your mind that you are to leave through the door on this level... the Imprisoned One will ensure that the seal is clear for you.~ []
@1063048 = ~Watcher's Keep

Odren has entered the Keep to confront Demogorgon, and will no doubt be killed in the process. An apparition appeared and offered me a scroll from Helm, Himself, which will allow me to seal both Demogorgon and the unfaithful Odren inside the Keep forever. I accepted it... and have only to use the scroll anywhere in the area outside of the prison... then the Imprisoned One's Lair will be sealed forever.~ []
@1063049 = ~Watcher's Keep

I have discovered that the ritual to keep the Imprisoned One sealed, here, has done the same to me, as well... something that the Knights of the Vigil hardly could have not known about. I have agreed to help free the Imprisoned One, who wants revenge as well and has agreed to open a small hole in the seal so I may escape... in order to free it, I will have to go to Odren and tell him that the Imprisoned One is dead... Odren will investigate and the Imprisoned One will kill him.~ []
@1063054 = ~Various sensations from the presence tell you that this is true... but there is an undertone of faint amusement. The other way out, it suspects, is to destroy it. Without the Imprisoned One within, no doubt the prison will open.~ []
@1063059 = ~The presence appears again, wondering if you have changed your mind yet... or perhaps you have found some other means of leaving?~ []
@1063064 = ~The presence is faint and tersely informs you to leave while you can... it cannot maintain the hole in the seal for long.~ []
@1063085 = ~An interesting question, indeed! I do have some knowledge of this matter. The crystal mallet is the key. Strike it against Carston's cage six times and the glass will dissolve.~ []
@1063091 = ~Watcher's Keep

Odren has entered the Keep to confront Demogorgon, and will no doubt be killed in the process. An apparition appeared and offered me a scroll from Helm, Himself, which will allow me to seal both Demogorgon and the unfaithful Odren inside the Keep forever. I declined to use it, though the apparition gave it to me anyway... it need only be used in front of the door that leads to Demogorgon. Instead, I intend to go and confront the Demon Prince, myself.~ []
@1063094 = ~I know a little of this matter. The torches must be fueled by the oils found in the colored vats. I suspect there is a specific pattern which must be followed, but I cannot say for sure.~ []

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 4 rounds 
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a giant disembodied hand to squeeze and constrict the target once per round for up to four rounds. It initially smashes the target for 3D6 damage with no save, and the target is held. In the second round, the target can save vs. paralyzation at a -2 penalty to escape. If the target fails their save, the hand does 4D6 damage. The following round, the target can save vs. paralyzation with no penalty. If the save is made, the target is free to move; otherwise, the spell does 6D6 damage and holds the target for 2 rounds. After the 4th round, the spell is finished. Magic resistance will stop the spell.~ []

@1063125 = ~But the baatezu be strong, indeed... it has been a challenge to... hmmm. Perhaps thou, mortal, might... nay. Nay, thou hast the stench of order and good on thee. Best to kill thee now and be done with it.~ []
@1063127 = ~But the baatezu be strong, indeed... it has been a challenge to... hmmm. Perhaps thou, mortal, might play a part in this. Dispatch the hated baatezu, Ka'rashur, and I would reward thee handsomely.~ []
@1063140 = ~Thou art a most intelligent being... for a mortal. The baatezu pit fiend, Ka'rashur, may be found elsewhere in this maze. I cannot tell thee where, exactly. Good hunting, fleshing!~ []
@1063143 = ~Is this so? What a grand day this would be... if it is true. Bring me the heart of that pit fiend, fleshling, and I shall reward thee handsomely for it. Something of magic... and our gratitude.~ []
@1063145 = ~Forget it... I'd rather destroy you here and now.~ []
@1063147 = ~Mmmm... most excellent of thee, fleshling. You have earned the gratitude of the tanar'ri. Odd, however, that we still cannot open our gate. Bah! Here is your reward... now begone and leave us be.~ [GORTAN11]
@1063152 = ~Bigby's Crushing Hand (Evocation) 
Level: 9
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 3 rounds 
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a huge disembodied fist that crushes the target and pins the target to the ground. In the first round, the spell does 2D10 damage. The victim can save vs. paralyzation at a -4 penalty to avoid being pinned. If the save is failed, the hand does 3D10 damage the next round. At this point, the victim can again save vs. paralyzation at a -2 penalty. If this save is failed, the hand does a final 4D10 damage and disappears.

(Conjuration/Summoning, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: Unlimited
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The Wish spell is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. The use of a Wish will not substantially change major realities. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Finally, the wiser the wizard, the better the chance that he or she will choose the right wording. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~ []
@1063161 = ~No I don't... but I intend to get it soon.~ []

@1063176 = ~But the tanar'ri be too strong; our battles are many and long. Perhaps you, mortal, might... nay. I sense you are too good to rid us of the hated brood. Best kill you now before trouble you become.~ []
@1063177 = ~But the tanar'ri be too strong; our battles have been many and long. You have great power, mortal, it is true... kill the baalor, Tahazzar, and be rewarded by the baatezu.~ [GORBAT14]
@1063179 = ~Magic is plentiful in Baator, you see, and while I cannot go there I may draw things to me. Something sufficient will be given to you... plus the goodwill of the baatezu.~ []
@1063181 = ~Ahhh... (hissss) ... it is always good to meet intelligent mortals. The Baalor, Tahazzar, is in this maze. Search the portals.~ []
@1063183 = ~(hisssss) ... I see. Then die quickly.~ []
@1063186 = ~This tanar'ri you speak of... I have already destroyed the demon, I believe.~ []
@1063187 = ~How grand that would be... if you speak true. Bring his heart to me, mortal, and I shall reward you. An item of power... and the goodwill of the baatezu.~ []
@1063189 = ~I will be pleased to have the heart soon... ah, to cause the tanar'ri ruin.~ []
@1063190 = ~Forget it... I'd rather destroy you here and now.~ []
@1063192 = ~This tanar'ri you speak of... I have already destroyed the demon, and I have its heart, here.~ []
@1063193 = ~You have the heart of the baalor! You have our gratitude forever more. (hisss)  Strange, though, that we still cannot gate... perhaps the tanar'ri had naught to do with our fate?~ [GORBAT15]
@1063196 = ~Ahhh... (hisssss)  The mortal returns once more. Sooooo... have you the heart of Tahazzar in tow?~ []
@1063198 = ~No I don't... but I intend to get it soon.~ []

Range: Unlimited
Duration: 2 rounds

Improved Alacrity essentially eliminates the need to pause between casting spells. Under its effects, a mage can begin casting a new spell the instant casting of the current spell is finished. This effect lasts for 2 rounds.

I have encountered a Cambion and his retinue inside of the maze. This one seems friendly enough and is mostly interested in gaming with me for a chance at his freedom from this place. In return for me putting up the holy symbol as stakes, he is willing to offer me a gem he has found... all based off of draws from a Deck of Many Things.~ []
@1063734 = ~The Gambling Cambion

The Cambion with an urge to play games of chance with his Deck of Many Things wasn't about to let me walk out of here with Helm's holy symbol... his key to freedom. The matter ended in violence, as it usually does... a bad gamble on his part.~ []

Let the events of this forgotten temple serve as an example to all who would follow the Vigilant One. Beneath this hallowed earth the avatar of the Watcher confronted great evil, a Prince of the Underplanes. 

Through steadfast perseverance Helm, Guardian of the Gods, fulfilled his sacred duty and bound the creature in the bowels of the temple that it might walk the world no more.

Speak not the beast's name, ye Knights of the Vigil, but guard this place. Protect the wards which seal the Imprisoned One within, and remain ever watchful.

Never betray your trust - such is the will of Helm.

@1064644 = ~No, it isn't. Ardic was taking his regular shift manning the battlements; he wouldn't be the first taken by an enemy arrow or some foul spell. Or maybe Mateo murdered him.~ []
@1064646 = ~Serpent Shaft +2~
@1064647 = ~That's a pretty weak case, if you ask me.~ []
@1064652 = ~Oh? I wouldn't know about that. Spend your time in the Abyss, girl, dead and destroyed... and we'll see just what sorts of dreams you have then. I'd wager you'd wilt like a flower in the heat.~ []
@1064654 = ~But you are still convicting Mateo solely on hearsay.~ []
@1064656 = ~If you knew the Countess, you would know her word is beyond reproach. And she has nothing to gain from a lie:  Mateo was Ardic's closest friend. Accusing him was very traumatic for her.~ []
@1064658 = ~So now you just sit back and wait for the executioner?~ []
@1064659 = ~Seems like you want to wrap this up with a quick execution.~ []
@1064661 = ~Mind if I come to watch the traitor's execution?~ []
@1064662 = ~Mateo will not be executed, not while we are under siege. The defense of Saradush is my first concern... but if I had more time, I would investigate further. I just want to find the truth.~ []
@1064664 = ~Perhaps I could delve deeper into this matter for you.~ []
@1064665 = ~Sounds like you want someone to investigate this matter further, Captain.~ []
@1064668 = ~If you wish to investigate further, I will not stand in your way. Speak to Mateo in his cell. The jailer will let you see him.~ []
@1064690 = ~I... live! Flesh and blood and bone! I am alive! Hahahahaha! I swore I would scratch and crawl my way back into the world of the living... and I have done it!~ [SAREVO76]

@1064705 = ~Hmph. You'd better. I don't... feel any differently, though. Somehow I thought I would.~ []
@1064706 = ~Did I not say it was only an insignificant portion? I suspected that doing it here, in this place, it might work... but I was not sure. It is good to see that I was correct after all.~ []
@1064710 = ~I did not get to where I did in life without risk, fool. It was no bluff... I knew enough to suspect that it might work, since our heritage was the same. But none of that is important. I imagine you are eager to hear what I have to say.~ []

@1064714 = ~But I cannot give you the ability to make this plane create such a portal. There are many barred passages in this plane of yours that I know little of. One, however, I can open... and beyond it lies what you seek. Watch...~ []
@1064715 = ~Enter that room and face your challenge, <CHARNAME>. It will be difficult... you may not want to do it alone. There is a... spirit... here which can summon those companions you require for your party, if you require such.~ []

@1064740 = ~I need Ardic's testimony to prove your innocence, Mateo.~ []
@1064750 = ~In my youth, I spent much of my time looking into the old lore of the dead Bhaal priesthood. I unearthed one of the old prophecies from an uncooperative sect of Cyric... one that spoke extensively of this time now upon us.~ [SAREVO78]

@1064765 = ~I know you're involved, Kiser. I just want a piece of the action.~ []
@1064768 = ~Your accusations are completely unfounded and without merit! Captain Samand has found Mateo to be the sole culpable perpetrator!~ []
@1064773 = ~No. Bhaal's essence left me as I died... and that which has been given to me now maintains my mortality only. Some might still consider me a Bhaalspawn, but it is solely a matter of history and memory.~ []
@1064787 = ~I know you're involved, Kiser. I just want a piece of the action.~ []

@1064798 = ~Ah, your visage registers surprise; did you presume I did not know both your identity and ancestry long before you stumbled into my dwelling? I present you with an offer, Bhaalspawn.~ []
@1064816 = ~Inelegant, yet precisely accurate. If you exterminate the enchanter Errard, I will reveal Ardic's hidden location, and I am certain his mother will reward you most handsomely upon their reunion.~ []
@1064817 = ~Killing wizards is hard business.~ []
@1064823 = ~I admit my culpability in Ardic's abduction, yet this does not implicate me in the betrayal of Saradush. Ardic did indeed see me near the gates, but I was not the guilty party.~ []
@1064827 = ~Very well, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, for now.~ []
@1064830 = ~No one would believe my account, not without substantial proof. Captain Samand is driven by a perverse desire to ruin me, and he was willing to convict me based on Ardic's speculative testimony.~ []
@1064832 = ~I will take an oath to follow you, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, if that will satisfy. Here... in this place... such an oath would have power, like a geas. I could not betray you.~ []
@1064833 = ~But why did you frame Mateo?~ []
@1064838 = ~Alright. If you swear an oath not to betray me... then you may join me.~ []
@1064840 = ~A farfetched tale. How do I know you are telling the truth?~ []
@1064848 = ~If any harm befalls me, I guarantee Ardic will never be found alive. If you desire to aid the Countess, you will help me exonerate myself.~ []
@1064855 = ~Alas, such an elementary resolution is not possible. While Errard lives, he is able to obfuscate investigation into his own actions. Only his demise will allow me to clear my own name.~ []
@1064859 = ~Regrettably, yes. I could not attempt such an endeavor myself, but you might prevail where I would falter. If not for me, consider how this will benefit Ardic, the Countess and even Saradush itself.~ []
@1064863 = ~You... will not require an oath? An... odd... choice, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. I would have required it of you. If I had even let you live. As you wish, then... let us attend to your challenge. Remember... consider that you may need more companions to complete it.~ []
@1064867 = ~You might make the attempt, but my death will not bring gain to anyone involved. I suggest you save your violent impulses for other individuals. Errard comes readily to mind.~ []
@1064868 = ~Very well. I, Sarevok, swear on the bitter ashes of my mother and the dead god that is my father, in the name of vengeance and the bitter bile that is my blood... I swear that I shall not betray <CHARNAME> so long as I live.~ []
@1064872 = ~Good enough. I may return for you later, then... wait here.~ []
@1064876 = ~As you wish. I shall wait for your return, <CHARNAME>. Remember... the challenge may be difficult. Consider summoning companions to your side.~ []
@1064878 = ~You turn your hand against me? I should have expected as much. I would do the same. I know how to leave this place on my own, however... may we not meet again, dear <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.~ []

@1064995 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

Melissan brought a general by the name of Gromnir Il-Khan to protect this town and its Bhaalspawn... only to have him lock himself within the castle out of paranoia. He refuses to see anyone and is destroying Saradush with his madness. Melissan believes he must be stopped before the besieging army can be dealt with.

I will have to find some way into the castle to deal with Gromnir. Perhaps the meeting will be a peaceful one, although Melissan believes Gromnir must be killed. I shall see.~ []
@1064998 = ~Saradush Under Siege

I find myself in the city of Saradush, surrounded by the army of Yaga-Shura - a Child of Bhaal. Within the city are a number of my own Bhaalspawn kin, led by a despot named Gromnir Il-Khan. It seems they cannot escape from the city (even by magical means) while the army is camped outside. 
~ []
@1065000 = ~Saradush Under Siege

I have spoken with Melissan, a woman claiming to be a friend and protector of the Children of Bhaal. She has promised me an explanation of why Yaga-Shura wants to kill me and all the other Bhaalspawn here if I can end this siege. 
~ []
@1065001 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

Pyrgam Aleson at the Tankard Tree told me there were legends of a secret entrance into the castle through an abandoned jail. He instructed me to talk to Sister Farielle at the Temple of Waukeen about getting into the now sealed jail.~ []
@1065002 = ~I cannot touch your own thread, Child... nor can I tell where it leads. I can, however, alter the threads of those whose lives are intertwined closely with your own, those whose destinies are tied to yours.~ []
@1065003 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

Sister Farielle gave me a key to the abandoned jail. Somewhere inside there is rumored to be a secret area which connects to the castle. The key opens the door across the street which leads to the abandoned dungeon. The Sister also suggested I bring some Holy Water to battle the undead I will likely encounter.~ []
@1065008 = ~If they are meant to be part of your future, yes. They will fall into your wake because their fates are tied to yours.~ []
@1065015 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

Captain Samand informed me of a plot to let the enemy into Saradush through a secret gate in the wall. On the testimony of Countess Santele the traitor, a young man named Mateo, has been taken to the Militia Headquarters. The Captain originally suspected a vile merchant named Kiser Jhaeri, and he suggested I go speak to Mateo at the Militia Headquarters if I wish to investigate this further.~ []

@1065032 = ~White Dragon Scale +6~
@1065037 = ~As you wish.~ []
@1065045 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

The Countess is dead, and Kiser has assured Saradush will fall by arranging the death of Errard. He has given me a key and told me I can find Ardic in a secret cell in the basement, though with his mother dead I doubt there would be any reward if I saved the young man now.~ []
@1065049 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

The wizard Errard told me Ardic is being held somewhere in Kiser's home. I need to return there to find Ardic so that his testimony can free Mateo and help convict Kiser Jhaeri.~ []
@1065051 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

Kiser Jhaeri is dead and Ardic is free. His testimony will exonerate Mateo, and the Countess will likely give me a nice reward for my efforts.~ []
@1065062 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

I managed to get into the castle, finally, and encountered the mad General. Whatever chance there might have been for a peaceful resolution was dashed as soon as I met Gromnir... he was obviously as mad as Melissan claimed. Regardless, he is dead now and his tyranny and his rampaging men will no longer be a problem for Saradush. There is, of course, still the problem of Yaga-Shura's army around the city...~ []
@1065064 = ~<CHARNAME>? It... it *is* you, isn't it? Ever since I left the circus, I wondered when I... I... that's odd. I... don't remember when I left the circus. What is this place?~ [AERI2531]
@1065066 = ~Gromnir knows a stranger came to Saradush, pretty Melissan. Another Bhaalspawn. You must think Gromnir too stupid not to remember there is no way in or out of the city, mmm? Heh heh...~ [GROM07]
@1065068 = ~We've traveled together before, Aerie. It's pretty complicated... join with me and I'll explain.~ []
@1065071 = ~Bhaalspawn mean nothing! Yaga-Shura is Bhaalspawn - he wants Gromnir's head, too! HAH ha ha! Foolish Melissan is plotting against Gromnir. Melissan is plotting the ruin of all the Children of Bhaal!~ [GROM09]
@1065074 = ~This is... part of the Abyss, I guess. I summoned you here.~ []
@1065076 = ~Join you? I... that does sound right, somehow. My own... abilities have grown since I last saw you. I had to leave the circus... the Cowled Wizards were growing angry with me, at my magic.~ []
@1065078 = ~Take Melissan away, but watch closely. Ha ha ha! Gromnir knows that Melissan is tricky; Melissan lies; Melissan... deceives... heh heh.~ [GROM12]
@1065079 = ~So the assassin is here! HAH!! Ha ha! Good fun! <CHARNAME> has come to kill Gromnir, eh?~ [GROM13]
@1065080 = ~I guess it didn't matter, not really. I was helping people, when I could... but... but every time I helped someone, there was always more despair. It... it was terrible.~ []
@1065081 = ~So I had to leave all my friends behind. I... I was thinking of traveling north to the mountains to search for my people. But... but this is just as well. I'll help you, <CHARNAME>, if you want me to.~ []
@1065086 = ~I do... just don't get out of line, elf, and keep your whining to a minimum.~ []
@1065087 = ~Wait here for now... I may need your help later.~ []
@1065088 = ~Is... is that how you treat people who help you? It... it seems so important that I help you, somehow... if it wasn't for that, I would go. Just... just keep your rudeness to yourself, or I will!~ []
@1065089 = ~You are mad, Gromnir! Have I not always aided you and all the other Bhaalspawn? I.. I brought you here to protect you - it was your paranoia that brought Yaga-Shura upon us!~ [SARMEL13]
@1065090 = ~Wait... wait here? It... it *does* seem important that I help you, somehow. Al-alright... I'll stay here, for awhile. But not for too long...~ []
@1065091 = ~I'm... not too surprised. My life has been strange since you left. Still... the Cowled Wizards are angry with me now, at my magic... I had to leave the circus.~ []
@1065094 = ~Please, Gromnir. <CHARNAME> just wants to talk to you. It may be our only way to defeat Yaga-Shura.~ []
@1065095 = ~You... summoned me? I... haven't I been traveling with you? No... no, I haven't, have I? But it seems so confused...~ []
@1065096 = ~The stranger is a friend, a Bhaalspawn, just like you.~ []
@1065097 = ~Your madness will be your death, Gromnir, nothing else... the death of you and all those who foolishly follow you.~ [SARMEL15]
@1065102 = ~Do... do you need my help, then? I'd be glad to travel with you again.~ [AERI2530]
@1065105 = ~Well... alright. This... this is a dreadful place. It frightens me, and... and reminds me a little of you, <CHARNAME>. D-don't leave me here too long.~ []
@1065107 = ~You... you want me to leave already?  I... I could still be a lot of help to you!~ [AERI2536]
@1065119 = ~Do... do you need my help, then? I'd be glad to travel with you again.~ []
@1065122 = ~Al-alright... although I feel rather useless just... just standing around.~ []
@1065127 = ~So our paths do cross once again. I knew they would, even when I first laid eyes upon you. So... what use do you have for me in this... this place?~ [ANOM2501]
@1065128 = ~Gromnir! <CHARNAME>! Lay aside your weapons! We must work together to... No! I... see I am too late to stop the bloodshed. You have slain Gromnir and many other Bhaalspawn, as well.~ [SARMEL16]
@1065136 = ~My duties with the Order are many... and my fellows have their suspicions about you, a spawn of the dead Lord of Murder. I can see the marks that the taint has made upon your soul.~ []
@1065137 = ~But I am not blind to the events that ravage the land. I will join you, <CHARNAME>, to see that the right prevails. And if you are part of these evils... then I will stop you.~ []
@1065141 = ~Perhaps not. It is difficult to say whether you will serve the cause of good or evil, in the end. But, by Helm, I will watch you closely and serve in what I believe is my best judgement.~ []
@1065144 = ~I am a high priest of Helm, and I can only serve as the Watcher wills. I do not claim to know where your destiny lies, Bhaalspawn... take me or leave me here.~ []
@1065147 = ~Stay here, then.~ []
@1065149 = ~My fate has brought me here, it seems... and I will live or die according to your actions. So be it, I am at your mercy, Bhaalspawn.~ []
@1065151 = ~You need my help, is it? I am no member of the Order, thanks to you... but I am still a priest of Helm, the Watcher God. I can see the marks that your taint has made on your soul.~ []
@1065155 = ~That does not sound as exciting, certainly... but I'll not tell you what to decide. Do as you wish.~ []
@1065159 = ~Forget it. Stay here and rot... I'll decide what to do with you later.~ []
@1065160 = ~Forget it. Stay here and rot... I'll decide what to do with you later.~ []
@1065161 = ~So... do you require me to travel with you, Bhaalspawn? Or am I to remain in this hellish place interminably?~ [ANOM2528]
@1065169 = ~As you say... although I have no desire to be standing about, if there is something else to be done.~ []
@1065173 = ~You wish to part company, my love? I hope you are only considering a temporary parting... I would not be away from you for long.~ [ANOM2533]
@1065174 = ~My mistake... stay with the party, Anomen.~ []
@1065175 = ~Wait here... it will not be for long.~ []
@1065181 = ~Ah. The balance has been wildly threatened... I and others of my brethren have felt it. And of course you are at the center of these events, Child of Bhaal.~ [CERN2501]
@1065187 = ~Then wait here... I will deal with you soon.~ []
@1065188 = ~How can it not be your goal? You serve the balance with every breath. Nature is as part of your soul as the taint which colors your fate... a balance in and of itself.~ []
@1065191 = ~You may not have the most stellar of reputations, <CHARNAME>, and you may pay close heed to the call of the taint in your soul... but can even you claim that you will not serve the balance in the end? None of us knows this for certain.~ []
@1065194 = ~Whether one may strive for evil or good, one can never be certain that the balance is not ultimately being served. If the balance is threatened, you may restore it no matter your intentions... or, at least, this is my hope.~ []
@1065198 = ~Wait here? This is an odd place, isn't it? Unnatural and alien... yet also natural. Alive. I believe I will be pleased to inspect it thoroughly before you come back.~ []
@1065200 = ~Yes... join with me, now.~ []
@1065201 = ~Not just yet... wait here awhile longer.~ []
@1065202 = ~That does not bother me in the slightest. Return when you wish. I find this strange plane of yours rather... fascinating.~ []
@1065207 = ~As you wish. I am sure you will proceed as you see fit... you are like a force of nature in many respects, my friend, and one that I am constantly awed to witness.~ []
@1065209 = ~Yes... join with me again, Cernd.~ []
@1065212 = ~That does not bother me in the slightest. Return when you wish. I find this strange plane of yours rather... fascinating.~ []
@1065213 = ~Then I shall harbor my patience and endurance as do the trees. Return when you will, my friend, and I shall endeavor to serve you then if I am able.~ []

@1065220 = ~Yes, I have. But not for your mouth... so join me and be quiet for once.~ []
@1065225 = ~Well of course you do. There is none better than I when it comes to the magical arts, and it is good you recognize your superiors.~ []
@1065234 = ~Back again? (I knew my superior skills would be needed sooner or later... they always do.)  I demand an apology for this outrage! Forced to stand about like some hireling at your beck and call! Such impudence!~ [EDWI2512]
@1065238 = ~What?! Aaargh!! (I swear one day I'll turn this monkey into a... a blind vole! Or a green slime! Or a slug ready to be ground to a pulpy mess under my bootheel, ah yes!)~ []
@1065239 = ~One might assume that there is some logic behind asking such a skilled wizard as I to leave... but I shall be damned if I can figure it out.~ [EDWI2514]
@1065242 = ~I'll send you back to the pocket plane... wait for me there.~ []

@1065343 = ~Not just yet... wait here awhile longer.~ []
@1065349 = ~Well, it's like my Uncle Spanky used to say... there's just no point in wetting your pants and screaming if you suddenly find yourself on another plane. Especially if you're dead. What kind of a start to the afterlife would that be? Better to just look like you know what you're doing and impress the hell out of everyone. Of course, Uncle Spanky didn't often follow his own advice. He was once laughed off of Mount Celestial by a pair of mischievous planetars, I hear. (Bastards!)~ []
@1065353 = ~Oh, is this how it's going to be? Insult the poor gnome and then tell him to get in the party? Hmph. Like I haven't anything better to do. Well, okay, so maybe I haven't. Turnip market's gone all to heck... might as well hook up with you again.~ []
@1065356 = ~Time for a little adventure, is it? I figured as much. I saw some ogres down in Amn capture a poor Bhaalspawn... a kobold, that one, my but that Bhaal got around, didn't he? Anyway, they were stewing him in a big iron pot and I thought to myself, "Jan, my boy, that's adventure you're smelling."~ []

Level: Quest
Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: Sight of the caster
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Up to 5 party members 
Saving Throw: Special 

A more powerful version of Raise Dead, this spell brings up to 5 party members back to life, and heals 3D10+1 hit points per level of the caster. The targets of the spell can regain the rest of their hit points by natural healing or curative magic.~ []

@1065594 = ~Saradush Under Siege

With Gromnir dead, Melissan feels there is but one hope to save Saradush:  slay Yaga-Shura, fire giant leader of the army besieging the city. Melissan believes the death of their leader will demoralize the army, and they will give up their attempts to breach the defenses of Saradush. I can use my pocket plane special ability to get out of the city.~ []

@1065623 = ~I am not the frightened girl you remember meeting. Or do you? I perceive that I have not been transported here so much as my history has been slightly altered... including my own experience of it.~ []
@1065625 = ~As for myself, yes... I am changed. In the short time since I knew you, I have become an archmage with real power. It is those talents you need, is it not? I presume that is why I am here.~ []
@1065637 = ~I am a bit... wary... of involving myself in your struggle, <CHARNAME>. To try and avoid it is to fight fate, however. I suppose I can only hope that good comes of it in the end.~ []
@1065641 = ~I hope you did not arrange for me to be here just to leave me on this plane. Or something worse. Very well... I will wait.~ []
@1065651 = ~I'll send you back to the pocket plane... wait there.~ []
@1065671 = ~It's... good to see you, too, <CHARNAME>. I must admit, I've thought about you since we last met. I would like to travel with you again.~ []

@1065685 = ~Hurry up and wait, eh? I'm a patient man... I can wait awhile, if that's what you want.~ []
@1065693 = ~I'll send you back to the pocket plane... wait there.~ []

@1065698 = ~I'll send you back to the pocket plane... wait for me there.~ []
@1065719 = ~My help? Ah, it must be because the drow are so renowned for their sense of nobility. So be it, <CHARNAME>. I am willing to join with you again... for now.~ []

@1065745 = ~I'm sending you back to the pocket plane... wait there.~ []
@1065769 = ~Defeating Yaga-Shura

Melissan has warned me that the fire giant Bhaal spawn is immune to all weapons and magic. Unless I can find some way to overcome his resistances any attempt to destroy him is doomed to failure. 

Perhaps the secret to defeating him can be found in a swamp deep within the Forest of Mir, where Yaga-Shura was raised. It is also possible that a cult of fire giants in the Marching Mountains knows a way to nullify Yaga-Shura's power.~ []
@1065773 = ~I'm surprised to see others in the glade, never mind soldiers. I was nervous to head this way, myself, considering the glade's history and everything... but I thought at the very least trouble would steer clear of it.~ []
@1065774 = ~Yes... yes, of course! I am Karthis al-Hezzar, a simple merchant. I... I normally take the road through Saradush, but I understand it's been closed with all the trouble there.~ []
@1065782 = ~All of his clerics and assassins are supposed to have died horribly, and so they haunt the glade and Bhaal's old temple. Spirits and other things seem... drawn there, as well.~ []

@1065838 = ~How ironic:  you are trying to get out, and I want to get in and see Gromnir.~ []
@1065842 = ~I've survived... that's all. And without your help, old man.~ []
@1065846 = ~Most of the Bhaalspawn just go along with his wild accusations, trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. But I can't stand it anymore.~ []
@1065853 = ~Now I understand why you're trying to escape this place.~ []
@1065854 = ~Gromnir has to keep you Bhaalspawn in line. Sounds like you just lack the stomach for leadership.~ []
@1065858 = ~Yes, you survive... at the cost of everything you were meant to be. I am dead for all the sacrifices I made for you, and you *will* be made to see the truth of it!~ []
@1065868 = ~The curse of my Bhaal-tainted blood.  Whenever I was afraid, I would suddenly be teleported to a completely new part of the world. Most disruptive, especially while I was being hunted.~ []
@1065873 = ~And Imoen... my second hope. You have turned her into a conspirator to your own failure. All her potential... lost. How both of you disgust me so.~ []
@1065877 = ~Are you another of Gromnir's Bhaalspawn followers?~ []
@1065879 = ~By other Bhaalspawn, of course. Yaga-Shura, for one. Others. Whenever I tried to build a life, the hunters would show up and poof - I'd jump. Or teleport, if you rather. It's not a very comfortable thing to live with.~ []
@1065891 = ~Then you know nothing of yourself! You have learned nothing! You grow ever closer to being a slave of your blood... you will murder all that you love and die a monster!~ []
@1065893 = ~No? You *will* be judged, <CHARNAME>. You have learned nothing of yourself. You will murder all that you love and you will die a monstrous slave to your blood... and I will not allow it!~ []
@1065896 = ~How many more must come to grief before you see I am correct? How many must die? What of your many former companions... how many are dead, now, because of you?~ [HGWRA107]
@1065902 = ~Fascinating tale. I'll be going now.~ []
@1065903 = ~Melissan was only trying to help me. She had the best of intentions, though obviously events have not worked out as we all hoped.~ []
@1065904 = ~I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me, but I should be going now.~ []
@1065915 = ~What is so inevitable?! <CHARNAME> has fought the greatest foes... there is nothing that could come between us!~ []

@1065952 = ~No! NOOOO!! (sob!)  No, please... make it stop, <CHARNAME>, make it STOP!!~ [AERI2545]
@1065953 = ~Insult me? Well, maybe I should just leave you here.~ []
@1065961 = ~Ah... free at last. I suppose I am in your debt. Well, I will be beholden to no <MANWOMAN>. Though it galls me, I will tell you what I know of Yaga-Shura.~ []

@1065971 = ~I should cut your tongue out for your impertinence... but since I have no weapon, and since you did save my life...~ []
@1065972 = ~My name is Ehlastra, a warrior from the Northern lands. I had heard legends of Yaga-Shura, a Child of Bhaal born unto a giantess. I came to this place to see if the legends were true.~ []

@1065975 = ~I... I am n-n-not even c-c-cold in the ground! And you are w-with him! You n-n-never loved me, Jaheira! You never loved me and you wanted me to die!!~ [2LOVE01]
@1065976 = ~So you came to kill Yaga-Shura?~ []
@1065979 = ~You simple fool! I came here to join Yaga-Shura, to offer my sword to his service, to follow the mighty giant as his army laid waste to the Southlands!~ []
@1065984 = ~I wanted to become part of his unstoppable war machine, to revel in the slaughter, to have my blade drip with the blood of all those Yaga-Shura crushed beneath his mighty boot!~ []
@1065986 = ~It seems you have been suitably punished for your savage bloodlust, Ehlastra.~ []
@1065988 = ~The fire giants in this Temple are short sighted fools. They recognized my warrior skills, but saw me only as a potential mate for Yaga-Shura, a chance for him to further spread Bhaal's seed.~ []
@1065989 = ~But now they are dead, and I yet survive. My only regret is that I could not kill Yaga-Shura's followers with my own hands. I have nothing more to say on this matter.~ []
@1065990 = ~Your instincts are not wrong:  I am a veteran warrior of many battles. But I have no desire to stay in this land. Once your questions are done, I will return to my Northern home.~ []
@1065991 = ~You look like you know how to handle a blade. Will you join up with my group?~ []
@1065992 = ~I have heard the legends - Yaga-Shura cannot be defeated, he is immune to all weapons and magic, he is invincible. Perhaps this is true.~ []
@1065996 = ~I... I am dead, Viconia. At long last, after the agony of being a loathsome drider for so many long years. I... could not take the torture. I couldn't.~ [3LOVE08]

@1066000 = ~You knew! I loved you... you were the center of my world, dalninil. Like no drow, I cared for you. And... you used me to get away. I became a drider, Viconia! You murdered me!~ [3LOVE10]

@1066068 = ~It is the boy... that traitorous fool of a half-giant boy of mine. You come because of Yaga-Shura! My boy has been a pain for you and I both, and you wish his blood, yes?~ []
@1066092 = ~Only Nyalee knows the words and the arts to extinguish the boy's heart, she does. But Nyalee needs her own heart to use the arts... and the boy stole her heart years ago. Keeps it, he does.~ []
@1066093 = ~Finds Nyalee's heart and Yaga-Shura's heart both, spawn-child... brings them both to her. Nyalee will quench his heart forever, then! Hee hee! So surprised, so shocked will he be!~ []

@1066112 = ~Defeating Yaga-Shura

I have encountered a witch by the name of Nyalee within the ruins of a Bhaal temple in the Haunted Glade. Nyalee raised Yaga-Shura and taught him to remove his heart and keep it ablaze as the secret to his invulnerability. His heart must be extinguished in order to remove his power. Nyalee will do it, but she needs me to bring her his heart... as well as her own, which Yaga-Shura has stolen.~ []
@1066117 = ~Defeating Yaga-Shura

I encountered a woman kept slave in Yaga-Shura's quarters who gave me some information. Apparently, the giant is obsessed with a small, golden chest that he keeps hidden within his stony bed. As well, she mentioned a crone by the name of Nyalee who knows something of Yaga-Shura's secrets... and that Nyalee can be found in the Forest of Mir.~ []

@1066137 = ~I may have... I have two hearts, here. Are they what you need?~ []
@1066141 = ~Yes... yes, at last Nyalee has her heart. Nyalee had forgotten how it feels to have a heart, she had. Many old memories. It makes Nyalee sad.~ [HGNYA08]

Only the final entry has survived in its entirety:

I finally have a plan to be rid of that sorry, slime loving excuse for a mage. If I turn my fan to its highest setting while the south-west door to his noxious laboratory is open the poison mist will be blown clear, making his noxious pets vulnerable! 

I must remember to use my lightning on that ooze puddle, unless I want thousands of those things crawling around the dungeon.

Soon I will put my plan into action, and be rid of his caustic presence forever!

... forces we do not comprehend... concentrate on my own research...   acid and poison are potent against its air incarnation...

The final words of the last page are the most legible:

... devised a way to be rid of the cold hearted monster. If I set the air mage's fan on high and open all the doors between the fan room, my own lab and the ice wizard's frigid chamber, the drafts will blow my toxic vapors down the hall towards the frost wizard's minions. Once touched by the poison gas they will become tainted and vulnerable. That snowblind fool won't know what hit him!   

I can then close the doors or turn the fan back to the low setting, and the gas will drift back into my noxious lab to preserve my own precious pets.~ []

Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal is split into two sections: 

1) An Add-In Section - a grand new adventure takes place at the Watcher's Keep, a new area on your map in BGII. The Keep can be played during the course of BGII. It can also be played after BGII in the Add-On section. Play the Add-In Section simply by loading a BGII save and going to the Watcher's Keep. 
2) An Add-On Section - This continues the main storyline of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Play the Add-On Section by finishing Baldur's Gate II:Shadows of Amn or by importing your character or party into Throne of Bhaal (see below.) The Watcher's Keep can also be accessed from the Add-On Section. Once you have started the Add-On section, you can no longer return to Shadows of Amn or its areas.

Clicking the New Game button will take you to the character creation screen where you can create a character to begin Throne of Bhaal at its beginning, shortly after the events chronicled in Shadows of Amn. You have the option of creating a brand new character, who will be outfitted with two million experience points and a variety of powerful weapons and items. You also have the option of importing a character from a saved game or from the character folder. These characters will also be given items and set to two million experience points, if they haven't already reached this level of experience.

Clicking the Import Game button will allow you to import your party from a BGII saved game, such as your final save from Shadows of Amn. This is also an option from which you can load your Throne of Bhaal saves once you've started the mission pack and saved a game.

Click Cancel to return to the previous menu. 

Please enjoy Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal.~ []

@1067064 = ~Balthazar is the leader of the monastic order within the fortress, and has been for quite some time. He is... not overly popular, as I'm sure you're well aware.~ []
@1067069 = ~It... it is to be expected, I suppose. Many say that Balthazar is one of the terrible spawn of the dead god, Bhaal. He prepares for war, no doubt, and we simply pray that this war does not come to Amkethran.

~ []
@1067076 = ~Melissan is a protector of all of Bhaal's children, it is said, just as Elminster protects those who harp. Why such a mage would protect godspawn who only bring terror and destruction I do not know... nor does anyone.~ []
@1067084 = ~The village grew up around the fortress, depending on their goodwill and guidance... which was received in abundance. At least, that is, until Balthazar became their leader. Now we are strangers.~ []
@1067094 = ~I have heard tales of great wars and destruction in the lands beyond the desert, and while the order has never involved itself in such things before, it seems Balthazar has changed things. He plans a war... a great and terrible war... but I do not know against whom.~ []

@1067125 = ~Hmph. Zakee's prices are outrageous! I suppose there's not much supply right now... but why should the tavern get everything?~ []
@1067127 = ~We're all doomed. Balthazar is raising an army to fight drow and mind flayers, of all things... we'll all be destroyed!~ []
@1067141 = ~I heard Athkatla was sacked within the last month by the Sythillisians. And then the great ogre, himself, was revealed as a Bhaalspawn and killed by some fire giant. Incredible story, I think.~ []
@1067147 = ~The Rune is getting impatient. Balthazar claims we will be fighting an army of dragons soon, but refuses to send us out or tell us when the battle will begin. And he seems to despise working with us... why he would even bother is beyond me.~ []
@1067148 = ~They say Balthazar is a Bhaalchild with great powers. Perhaps he plans conquest? It does not appear so... although appearances can be deceiving.~ []
@1067187 = ~When Gromnir Il-Khan arrived with the remnants of his army, he quickly drove out Count Santele and his forces. The Count wasn't missed... at least not until Gromnir proved to be worse.~ []

@1067263 = ~The journal is thick and filled out with various entries that are, at first, legible elvish... relating the writer's horror at being trapped in the maze, his frustration at the fact that even retracing your steps through a portal you have just traveled through will not lead you back to the area you just came from. The writer is obviously morose and guilty over abandoning his dead comrades, and his writing suffers over time... slowly degenerating into mad scribbles, paranoid ramblings about demons and wild, repeated references to 'Yakman' written all over the journal.

Only once does the mad scripture give way to a clear section, some form of poetry which may be some manner of directions... or may be nothing more than drivel.

"I stand in the room that shows the way,
 and I must get out of here.
 I flee towards the rising sun,
 to find the pillar of stone is near."

"I continue from there as I began,
 and with the demon speak.
 He bids me south to journey onward,
 to run and not be weak."

"South until the obelisk I find,
 with runes on every face.
 The setting sun draws me on, then,
 into its fiery red embrace."

"From there I flee to the coldest north,
 and lay down by the tree.
 But even there the north still calls,
 as to the north I'm free."~ []
@1067265 = ~The booklet is an extremely old and tattered journal of an adventurer by the name of Sir Kalthorine ut Wistan. The pages are yellowed with age and have been damaged by taloned feet walking over them... but various pieces are still readable. Sir Kalthorine comments more specifically on the dangers of finding his way past the demons and devils of this level of the keep, noting especially the 'dead magic zones' in the blue rooms and the 'wild magic zones' in the red rooms and that he had mostly reassembled the needed 'Scepter of Radiance'.

One comment Sir Kalthorine makes is on the portals, themselves: he thought the fact that you could re-enter a portal you had just emerged from and not come out in the room it led from to be interesting... and considered the possibility that such a fact might be important in finding one's way through the maze.

Beyond this, the only lengthy part seems to be Sir Kalthorine's utter disgust at the 'betrayal' of the Knights of the Vigil for his predicament. Nothing more detailed can be found about this, and it seems especially odd as the journal appears to be perhaps half a century old or more.~ []

@1067542 = ~Hah! You are a fool to think the Five are defeated, now. Of all of Bhaal's children, who do you think possessed the most of his essence? You, certainly... but we Five, as well.~ [2YAGA21]
@1067543 = ~How many of the Five have you killed? Myself? Illasera? Probably Abazigal and Sendai, too? That is a lot of Bhaal's essence... and still one Bhaalspawn remaining.~ [2YAGA22]
@1067545 = ~Yes... Balthazar. If anything, fool, you have stirred Bhaal in His slumber. He is closer, now, to awakening than ever before!~ [2YAGA23]
@1067552 = ~I have no need of allies who cannot deal with their own problems. Perhaps once I have squashed you I will have to reevaluate my relationship with Sendai.~ []

@1067575 = ~You are no goddess yet, mortal. The prophecy has not come to fruition.~ [SOLAR69]
@1067576 = ~It will soon enough. Everything has happened as I wished it... and this will be no different. All of Bhaal's essence will be mine!~ [MELISS09]
@1067578 = ~True enough! So be it. My name is Amelyssan the Blackhearted, High Matriarch and greatest Deathstalker of my Lord Murder's Bhaalist temple. 'Twas I who led all the chants in His holy name!~ [MELISS10]
@1067579 = ~'Twas I who harbored his avatar when the Lord of Murder was cast down to walk amongst us in the Time of Troubles. To his greatest priestess did he come for succor!~ [MELISS11]
@1067581 = ~One of His priesthood needed to have access to the essence that would be collected from the Bhaalspawn... one of His priesthood would have to perform the necessary rites to give the dead Lord of Murder back that essence.~ [MELISS12]
@1067583 = ~And so you have betrayed me, Amelyssan the Blackhearted. The time draws nigh and yet you perform no rites!~ [BHAAL08]
@1067585 = ~It was I who created the Five... loosed the god-spawn at each other's throats all the while promising those fools that they would serve at Bhaal's right hand. Well they can... in Limbo, for all I care.~ [MELISS15]
@1067588 = ~No, that's true. I knew that Illasera would perish against your might... but I did not expect you to show up quite so soon. Still, you proved a fortunate arrival.~ [MELISS17]
@1067589 = ~Getting rid of one of the Five without it looking like my doing was one thing... but with you already in Saradush, I could turn you on Yaga-Shura as well. After I let him into Saradush to kill the other Bhaalspawn, of course.~ [MELISS18]
@1067590 = ~And then you turned on the rest of those paranoid fools while I distracted them. The Five were the last thing I had to deal with before I could become the Lady of Murder, myself... and you've dealt with them nicely.~ [MELISS19]

@1067603 = ~I am nearly a goddess... with your essence added to that of the rest of the Bhaalspawn, I will control all of Bhaal's abyssal realm, the Throne of Blood.~ [MELISS22]
@1067605 = ~I'd confront your kind of evil wherever I had to go... and I will win.~ []
@1067612 = ~Your course is set, god-child. Return to your pocket plane... and when you are ready, you will need to end its existence. Then you will be within the Throne of Blood... and Melissan will be at hand.~ [SOLAR72]

@1067637 = ~I... I can help you. Help you to defeat Abazigal. I know the secrets of this place. I feared my knowledge would die with me, but now I can pass it on to you!~ []
@1067654 = ~Perhaps you have the power to break Abazigal's spell, Bhaalspawn. You have the scroll of Reversal. I feel... its power. Free me from... my bondage!~ [BAZDR311] // She sounds like she's taking a dump here.
@1067658 = ~I... welcome... such... release.~ [BAZDR312] // In this one, she sounds like she's been hittin' the sauce. Careful now, sexy, you don't want to fall.
@1067662 = ~I will... give you... the wardstone... to pass. You can... kill... Abazigal!~ [BAZDR313] // For this one, we want you to act like you're dying (do it like you were in high school drama class) and read the lines, simultaneously. It'll be cool.
@1067666 = ~The enchantment is broken! I am free from this accursed servitude to that bastard half-breed! Free to leave this place and never return!~ [BAZDR314] // Well, as far as this lady goes, this one's OK.
@1067669 = ~You are a fool, puny <RACE>, to bargain with a dragon. We care little for promises made to the likes of you.~ [BAZDR315] // Damn. She must have been on a roll that day.
@1067671 = ~But you are in luck, tiny <MANWOMAN>. Abazigal must pay for what he did to me, but I am not eager to allow myself to fall victim to his snares once more.~ [BAZDR316] // (giggle) Like, oh my God, I'm, like, so mad!
@1067675 = ~Therefore, I will honor our agreement and give you the wardstone before I leave this vile place. May you extract unholy vengeance on the mongrel half-breed's head!~ [BAZDR317] // Most people breathe, but not this lady. She has iron lungs.
@1067697 = ~I am the child of a god! Did you really think your pathetic army could stop me?~ []
@1067700 = ~No, in truth I had other plans for my army. But since you killed Abazigal and Sendai, I have no further need of these mercenaries who so drain the monastery's treasury.~ []
@1067720 = ~Assault on the Enclaves

Both Sendai and Abazigal are dead, but I have been shown a disturbing vision:  Balthazar and Melissan locked in fierce combat. The disappearance of Lady Melissan is suddenly not so strange, and I cannot help but wonder at the depths of Balthazar's involvement with the Five.
To find answers I must somehow find a way into the monastery and confront Balthazar... though I suspect one of us will not survive the encounter.

~ []
@1067721 = ~Assault on the Enclaves

My old friend Saemon has shown up yet again, warning me that Balthazar's army of mercenaries is waiting for me should I enter the town. The deceitful pirate promised to get me inside, but I spurned his offer. I have been betrayed by Saemon one too many times to trust him again.~ []
@1067735 = ~People sing the praises of your name, <CHARNAME>. You strive to walk the path of virtue. But your intentions are meaningless compared to the consequences of your existence.~ []

@1067743 = ~And as your power grows, <CHARNAME>, so shall the ruin sown in your passing. Kingdoms will fall, and the rivers of Faerun will run with blood.~ [BALTHA16]
@1067747 = ~Assault on the Enclaves

Balthazar revealed himself as a Bhaalspawn, and one of the Five - though he never shared their goal of resurrecting Bhaal. The mad monk wanted to wipe the taint of Bhaal from the world by killing all of Bhaal's children, including himself.
More disturbing were the implications he leveled at the still-absent Melissan. If his words are true, she has been manipulating me the entire time for her own nefarious purposes.~ []
@1067749 = ~I know it's hard when you learn your father was a god of pure evil. You just have to find a way to deal with it... I did. Eventually.~ []
@1067751 = ~That reminds me of my great uncle Hegemony... not that he was much of an uncle, you understand. Always in dispute with the local lord over his rights to the surrounding farmlands. The duke had him thrown in prison for a year and a day before the duke's mother revealed Hegemony was actually a distant relation of the royal family - something about a drunken tryst between the duke's grandfather's brothers and a comely gnomish lass... details are sketchy.~ []
@1067753 = ~Not really. The duke didn't want Hegemony making any claims against his throne (or whatever those fancy muck-a-mucks sit on), so he banished Hegemony's family and sent my uncle himself to the guillotine. After the execution, they returned the body to his family, but nobody could remember where they had stashed his upper portions. All worked out in the end, though... Hegemony's family couldn't afford a full length coffin, anyway.~ []
@1067754 = ~I was just struck by the coincidence, is all. The royal blood running through great uncle Hegemony's veins was as thin as your own Bhaalspawn essence, friend... and in the end it kept his family from getting ahead. 
Huh... you look a little pale there. Why don't you just forget I ever brought it up.~ []
@1067756 = ~By your sniveling manners I would say Bhaal's blood runs very thin indeed in your veins. Bah - why do I even waste my breath tormenting this cowering cur?~ []
@1067766 = ~I've seen her type before:  noble woman looking to ease her own conscience by helping the lower classes.~ []
@1067767 = ~Everywhere ye go, ye find bloody do-gooders sticking thar noses in where they canna be welcome!~ []
@1067768 = ~Har! A little pickle tickle with the Sister in the back of the church, eh? Ye know what they say... nun is better! HAR! HAR! HAR!~ []
@1067769 = ~How amusing you surface dwellers can be. Instead of reveling in the pleasures of the flesh, you insist on shaming yourselves into guilt over your dalliances. Foolish rivvin!~ []
@1067781 = ~Then my sisters and I shall leave you to your misery, mortal one. Come, alou fiends... perhaps there is a hapless baatezu about that we can torment.~ []
@1067784 = ~Fine... one kiss and you lead me out of here.~ []
@1067788 = ~You are most adventurous, mortal... I like that in a <MALEFEMALE>. One quick embrace, then, and we shall do as we bargained. (giggle!)~ []
@1067789 = ~Here you are, dear one. This is the cavern you seek. Whether the portal still works... or if the cambion will even let you use it... is another matter entirely. (giggle!)  Enjoy!~ []
@1067790 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>... I see you have finally found your way to the Throne of Bhaal. You should know, however, that you're far, far too late.~ [FINMEL24]
@1067791 = ~This part of the Abyss was once your father's and might have been partly yours... but it's mine, now. Along with all the essence of a god, this place is mine to rule as I wish.~ []
@1067794 = ~You manipulated me, you deceitful harpy... and you will pay!~ []
@1067795 = ~You should have remained true to Bhaal... only he could have saved you, now!~ []
@1067801 = ~But it doesn't matter, in the long run. You've served me well enough... and now it is time for your essence to be added back to my power.~ []
@1067802 = ~I should not be wasting time on you. I still have to absorb the Bhaalspawn essences... and there is more than enough power in this plane to keep you busy.~ [FINMEL25]
@1067804 = ~Enough! I have gathered enough essence to deal with you... I will wait no longer to end your pathetic life. Prepare to join your siblings, <CHARNAME>.~ [FINMEL26]
@1067805 = ~No! Too... strong! Damn you! I must take more essence... I must have more power!!~ [FINMEL27]
@1067806 = ~So you are stronger than even I imagined. So be it, <CHARNAME>. Your destiny versus mine... let's finish this now, once and for all. To the victor go the spoils!~ [FINMEL28]
@1067812 = ~You are no god, priestess of Bhaal. You play with stolen energies that make you immortal, that give you great power... but that does not make you a god.~ [SOLAR75]
@1067815 = ~N-no... (nggh!)  I... I will kill you all!~ [FINMEL31]
@1067817 = ~The time that was mentioned has come, godchild. There is a choice before you... you have prevailed against all that have assailed you, and now you must decide your fate.~ [SOLAR78]
@1067822 = ~If I could have gotten rid of it voluntarily, I would have done it a long time ago. (shudder)  Take it... I don't want it. I never wanted it.~ []
@1067825 = ~You mean me, don't you? You're talking about the part of me that's... the taint. The powers I've developed.~ []
@1067829 = ~Shove your wisdom... I fought to get here and I earned my place.~ []
@1067837 = ~You may surrender that which you have always possessed. The rest still remains within Amelyssan and must be dealt with... and there will always be consequences. I shall tell you your options.~ [SOLAR84]
@1067839 = ~First, you may choose to surrender that portion of the essence which remains with you. It shall be given to Amelyssan... and her soul, with all the essence it contains, shall be destroyed.~ [SOLAR86]
@1067861 = ~No doubt you are willing to embrace the sheer evil of Bhaal's essence. Certainly you have ambition to rival Bhaal or his priestess... and you shall assuredly meet the same folly. You disgust me.~ [SOLAR97]
@1067876 = ~Hmph. I nay see the difficulty for ye, <CHARNAME>. Take yer power... ye fought for it hard an' well enough, there be no need to give it up and no-one worth givin' it up for.~ [KORG2519]
@1067878 = ~And besides all o' that... if ye becomes a power ye can reward us all the better for following ye about all these months. I've had enough of yer smell... some gold would be fine, indeed! Har har!!~ [KORG2520]
@1067883 = ~I would offer you only one piece of advice, <CHARNAME>. Rid yourself of the sins of your father... do not live under his shadow, but make your own destiny. You can do better, I think. You do not need this power.~ [CERN2515]
@1067884 = ~Simple enough for me to say, however. I can only imagine how attractive such an alternative might seem. In the end, the balance will win out... in the larger scheme your choice will mean little except to yourself.~ []
@1067892 = ~Well, you know, it's funny that this situation should come up. It's not something that I like to think about much, but I spent a whole year as a god back in '03. Oh, I know what you're thinking... why only a year? It's a touching and involved tale, but I'm happy to shed some light on it if it helps with your predicament.~ [JANJ2521]
@1067899 = ~It's nice to hear you eager, for once. It's not every day that a gnome finds himself in the middle of the Abyss fighting an avatar and talking to a solar, you know. I haven't done that for at least a year, now... although to be honest, the last time was only in the company of Aunt Patty and we all know what a pushover her Larry was... and it's nice to see that my tribulations in this party are recognized.~ []
@1067902 = ~Being a god isn't what you'd expect, though. Sune was all over me from day one... I hear she developed a thing for turnips about a decade ago. She just wouldn't leave me alone! There were parties at all hours of the night, Lliira would get plastered and fall into the lily pond and eventually Torm would start a brawl with somebody. Did you know what it's like to have Helm pounding on your door at three in the morning? I could never get any sleep at all. If it wasn't one thing it was getting slapped by Umberlee or hit on by Loviatar. All night long... and in the morning, all the gods would be in a foul mood. Terrible.~ []
@1067903 = ~I couldn't find anything good about the experience at all. No wonder Ao kicked them all out. He probably had to catch up on his housekeeping, of all things. Well, after all of that I was more than happy to let Cyric have the job, eager puppy that he was. Left it behind me for a turnip farm and a nice pension, and gladly... although I eventually traded the pension for some stock in a Spelljammer trading cruiser, which was a bad decision but all us mortals aren't immune to that, of course. Lost the farm, too, in a game of checkers to Uncle Fibbert. But that turned out all right, as the turnips got a bad rot that year and Uncle Fibbert died of too much intestinal gas. Poor man.~ []
@1067904 = ~Anyhow, I hope all my experience has been of some help. Ummm... feel free to accept other opinions. Ummm... no need to stare, now. Move on, move on.~ []
@1067907 = ~A life on the planes as a new power? 'Tis not a life for everyone, my raven. No matter how powerful you assume yourself to be, there is always another stronger... and in the planes, this is doubly so.~ [HAER2517]
@1067910 = ~I might accept the power of an evil god if I thought I could help people... but I won't fool myself. I would be tempted by the taint just like anyone else. But you know more about yourself than I do.~ []
@1067912 = ~No! Say it is not so! We will no longer fight evil together? Boo will miss you, <CHARNAME>. Forever shall we hang our heads in sadness in remembrance of our great butt-kicking friend.~ [MINS2519]
@1067914 = ~I urge you not to accept the taint. There is too much folly in such power, as you yourself have taught me. Do not make the mistake... refuse it and live the life you wish.~ [SAREVO82]
@1067916 = ~Do not waver. Were I in your shoes, I would lunge at this opportunity... it is no less than what I died attempting. Take it... grab hold of what you deserve!~ [SAREVO83]
@1067917 = ~So... it's finally come down to this, has it? After all we've been through, right from Candlekeep and Baldur's Gate, through Irenicus and Bodhi and their plans... I wonder what Gorion would say now?~ [IMOE2527]
@1067920 = ~It seems my promise to Gorion is at last at an end. It will be... difficult to watch you move on to a higher state of being, if that is where you choose to go. But you hardly need my guidance any longer.~ [JAHE2511]
@1067922 = ~What a terrible thing to decide! You... you've fought for so long to get to this point... but if you choose to keep all this power, there will be nothing more than more fighting...~ [AERI2533]
@1067923 = ~I... I couldn't do it. I wouldn't want to. What a frightening thing to become. But... you've never taken the easy path, have you, <CHARNAME>?~ []
@1067926 = ~Fail to do so and the only point to your having come this far will be to have fought off all those who sought to stop you. There is only one path... take it and perhaps I will even be the first of your clerics one day! Think of it!~ []
@1067955 = ~There was a time I didn't know what love was... I thought that we needed to be apart until I realized that just because you were my first love didn't make it any less real. You've done so much for me, I can't even begin to explain. And now you've given me a child.~ []
@1067956 = ~But if you feel that you need to accept this power... and that I have to let you go... than I suppose I can do that. It will... hurt. Just the thought of it makes me want to scream.~ []
@1067957 = ~But I couldn't have you hate me for holding you back from what you deserve. If I was in your position, I don't know if I could do the same.  A child, love, our future together... what are these mortal concerns next to the power and responsibilities of an immortal?~ []
@1067959 = ~And I love you. Oooh, sometimes I love you so much it hurts. I lie awake at night and wonder what kind of future we could have or what will happen to our child. I don't know... and neither do you.~ []
@1067960 = ~I don't blame you. Us... how we feel about each other... even our child... those can't be the only considerations. I lie awake sometimes thinking what kind of future we might have. I don't know... and neither do you.~ []
@1067962 = ~You... could? Yes, I suppose you could do almost anything, couldn't you? Except keep us together.~ []
@1067975 = ~I should expect that you would take the power offered by your blood. To do anything else would be an expression of maudlin weakness... and I expect far more from you, <CHARNAME>.~ []
@1067977 = ~If you gave up your heritage, what would we do? Where would we go? What if it was not satisfactory for you... would you not blame me in the end for keeping you from your power?~ []
@1067978 = ~I will not be responsible for that. As much as part of me might wish you to remain with me, my ssinssrigg... I will be just as pleased to know that you have achieved the power you deserved.~ []
@1067981 = ~But... I am not the same drow that I once was. You have planted questions in my head, made me think about my life on the surface. I have changed considerably, thanks to your interference.~ []
@1067982 = ~And this is not necessarily a bad thing. I changed my mind about our relationship, after all. You have brought me much joy... a quality I did not know I was even capable of.~ []
@1067983 = ~I trust that you will make the decision that is right for you. That is not my worry. I would only regret if we parted ways and I did not... thank you sufficiently. For all you have done.~ []

@1068165 = ~You are just... oh!~ []
@1068168 = ~But Boo's question is of such a personal nature... well, the thought of it makes me blush right down to my buttocks.~ []
@1068169 = ~I... see. Perhaps Boo should ask me anyway to get it off his chest. We... wouldn't want a hamster to bottle up all that anxiety, now, would we?~ []
@1068170 = ~You are very insightful! Such bottling could lead to all sorts of un-hamster-like explosions! Well... Boo wonders why you do not perform all your duties, since you are our witch?~ []
@1068171 = ~Well... a Rashemeni witch accompanies a ranger on his dajemma and teaches him the lore of herbs, among other things. Well... Minsc and Boo have discovered a need of some of this lore, maybe.~ []
@1068173 = ~My duties? I thought you were supposed to protect me... I didn't know there were any duties involved. And what's so personal about this?~ []
@1068177 = ~I... I... ah, I'll do what I can, Minsc.~ []
@1068184 = ~My stories aren't pointless! Now where was I? Oh, that's right. Gabber. His tongue was nothing but a long, skinny piece of flesh by the time the disease was done with it. But Gabber was determined to learn to talk. He did tongue exercises and tongue stretches everyday, and his tongue kept getting longer and more nimble the more he worked with it. They say he was able to pick locks with his unusual appendage, though I never had the privilege of witnessing that feat myself. By the time he was a young man he could flick that thing out a full two feet in front of his face and make the tip twirl like a Calim veil dancer.~ []
@1068188 = ~Too bad he came to such a tragic ending. Gabber wasn't much of a looker, you know, and he couldn't say a word with that freakishly long tongue of his. But for some inexplicable reason the ladies loved him. In the end, that was what did him in. Nomis Stormfingers, an extremely large and jealous village smith, found my unfortunate cousin in a compromising position with Mrs. Stormfingers. Nomis reached inside Gabber's mouth, yanked that long lingua out, looped it around his throat and strangled him with it. Lynched him with his own tongue, if you can believe it.~ []
@1068189 = ~Nalia, I've noticed that you've been very quiet as of late. Grim, even. Is... something wrong?~ [AERI2515]
@1068191 = ~Well, no... it's just that you used to be friendlier.~ []
@1068198 = ~Haer'Dalis... you've been staring at our leader with that look off and on for several hours, now. Don't you think that's a little rude?~ [AERI2516]
@1068199 = ~Of course not! That's why you remind me so much of Gabber:  you're both tongue tied.~ []
@1068201 = ~I find myself unable to tear my eyes away. In the Doomguard we appreciate the forces of entropy that bring destruction in their wake... and with each passing day I see a personification of that force taking shape before me.~ [HAER2508]
@1068222 = ~Why, Edwin? Not content with the modern discord you sow? Do you seek tutelage from the evils of old?~ []
@1068227 = ~Ah, no. Enough, Edwin. You hide your intent no better than your basic nature. I have no secrets for you, or anyone like you.~ []
@1068232 = ~There was no heroism, Anomen, only slow brutal death and grim deeds. We shall speak no more of this.~ []
@1068233 = ~Er...~ []
@1068235 = ~(Monkeys... unworthy little monkeys, all of them.)~ []
@1068236 = ~Anomen, my friend, I realize that I've been less than polite with you in the past and I wish to apologize.~ [JANJ2502]
@1068240 = ~Ha ha! If I didn't know you better, Valygar, I think I'd have to take that the wrong way! Heh...~ [AERI2529]
@1068241 = ~Indeed! All know that you're an unrepentant ass. 'Tis not my place to bring it up.~ []
@1068246 = ~I... didn't mean to joke about that. I know about your past... and I don't think I could ever be like that. Magic is a power I can use to help people, and that's all.~ []
@1068248 = ~Arrogant, drunken, piggish, whiny, pompous are common adjectives used to describe you, but I was wrong to say so. You are completely incapable of independent thought and soil yourself with regularity seldom found outside of the nursery. I shall no longer bring these things up in front of others.~ []
@1068259 = ~I care nothing for what you will have, fool, no matter how you gild your words. Be thankful for my scrutiny. Very few rivals outside the Red Wizards are worthy of it.~ [EDWI2506]
@1068262 = ~It might benefit your heart and soul to speak of your troubles, my friend.~ []
@1068268 = ~'Tis exactly that subject I wish to discuss. Now, it's common knowledge that knights are cleric initiates who are too stupid and ugly to be presentable in church.~ []
@1068273 = ~Of course you didn't 'fail'! They have to tell the failures something to keep up blind obedience, that is to say, morale.~ []
@1068275 = ~As you wish, Valygar. I shall bother you no more, though I shall say a prayer to Helm that he may help you with your burden.~ []
@1068289 = ~No, 'twas the fish heads that earned him that moniker. Real name is Rooctal or Slooble or something. I can't recall. Why, as Pappy used to say, 'If you can't join 'em, take your boot and --~ []
@1068293 = ~Well you did walk into that one. You should have ignored him.~ []
@1068294 = ~No... no, it's alright, Anomen. I probably should face up to the fact that I will have to return to Faenya-Dale one day. To face them, if nothing else. But certainly not now.~ []
@1068298 = ~That is cruel of you, Anomen. If I return to Faenya-Dale one day, it will be because I am ready to... not because someone felt it necessary to bully me into it.~ []
@1068301 = ~... which is really the reason I had the donkey to begin with. Good luck with the rash!~ []
@1068313 = ~So, Anomen, Boo and I had a question about the lodge you seem to hold above all else.~ [MINS2507]
@1068334 = ~Perhaps. I do not know what destiny awaits you, I have seen how power can destroy those who lust after it.~ []
@1068335 = ~So... Sarevok. You've had an itty-bitty piece of my soul in there for quite a while, now. What's it been like?~ [IMOE2502]
@1068340 = ~(sigh)  Well, other than a slight obsession with my weight and the resurgence of a few pimples, it's been simply grand. Now leave me be, girl.~ [SAREVO64]
@1068361 = ~Valygar, I have no wish to offend you, but I can remain silent no longer. You are a great warrior and a true defender of what is moral and right...~ [KELD2504]
@1068364 = ~There's something evil growing within you. The part of me that is devoted to Baervan reels from it... even though I know that it has nothing to do with the person you are, that it's separate.~ []
@1068366 = ~Keldorn, do not waste your breath trying to convert this heathen. I respect what you stand for, but I have no need of a god to serve... even one as worthy as Helm.~ []
@1068368 = ~I will take your words as a compliment, Keldorn... and not as a high handed condemnation of my own beliefs. If you find comfort believing I unwittingly serve Helm, I shall not object.~ []
@1068390 = ~I have a question for you, my friend... and it is something I wish you would treat with the sincerity in which it is meant. Do you believe that your ultimate destiny lies in godhood?~ [ANOM2514]
@1068402 = ~It appears your destiny may be far greater then perhaps even you at first suspected. Great power awaits you, and I cannot help but remember that you carry the blood of Bhaal within your veins.~ []
@1068407 = ~I fear for you, <CHARNAME>... and I fear you as well. I will stand by your side as long as you walk in the light of truth and justice. And I will help you resist the evil within yourself.~ []
@1068420 = ~I will say a prayer for you, <CHARNAME>, and ask Helm to guide our steps down the path of your destiny.~ []
@1068456 = ~Nothing to add?~ []
@1068477 = ~You look a little down, Edwin. You're not upset, are you?~ [IMOE2505]
@1068484 = ~WHA! What... is it... NOW!~ []
@1068486 = ~Now that was just... you are just being...~ []
@1068488 = ~(grumble) ... whelp... child... monkey-brained... how would you like your flaming death you... grrrr...~ []
@1068489 = ~A moment, Imoen, if you don't mind.~ [JAHE2512]
@1068505 = ~Ah, finally someone who appreciates my tales! A story about dwarves, eh? Let me see... of course:  my cousin Kimble. Not himself a dwarf, per say, but Kimble always was of peculiar tastes for a gnome. He fell in love with a dwarven lass. She was stout and stocky, with a gruff voice and a soft, supple, full beard...~ [JANJ2515]
@1068506 = ~Ah, gnome, ye know how to paint a lovely picture... such a beauty she must ha' been!~ []
@1068507 = ~Oh yes, she was a fine looking woman... to Kimble's eyes, at least. She cast a spell on him far stronger than any sorcerer ever could. But she wouldn't have anything to do with my cousin - she had dwarven princes and clan lords after her calloused hand, and she couldn't be bothered with a dirt-poor turnip-farming gnome. But Kimble's heart wouldn't be denied... he left his own family to follow this bewitching creature back to her clan home.~ []
@1068508 = ~Yer losin' me, gnome... I don't want some weepy love story. I want killin' and death! Give me blood!~ []
@1068509 = ~You wanted a story about dwarves, and this is the only one I've got. I can't just make up a lie, you know... that would be an affront to the grand tradition of storytelling in my family! Now, where was I? Oh yes, Kimble. My cousin followed the lovely dwarven lass to her clan home in the Alimir Mountains, and started a turnip farm there. He had a rough go of it at first, let me tell you... taxes, levies, zoning restrictions. It was almost like the dwarves didn't want him and his farm there. But they had never tried turnips, so they didn't really know what they were missing.~ []
@1068510 = ~Once those turnips started to sprout things changed in a hurry. Turns out the dwarves of that particular clan LOVED turnips. Fried, baked, boiled, whipped, pureed, mashed - you couldn't find a meal of the day that they didn't have turnips with. Turnips became so fashionable the dwarves began to wear clothes made from turnips. Never did a dwarf look so snazzy (or smell so appetizing) as when he was dressed up in a turnip top hat and turnip tails, with turnip skin shoes to complete the ensemble. And with his turnip business booming, Kimble found himself with more wealth than he knew what to do with. Just walking around his house was an effort, what with all the mountains of gold spilling out of every door of every room.~ []
@1068513 = ~Happy ending? I never said any such thing. Kimble was rich, true enough, but it turned out his dwarven love didn't share her clan's fondness for turnips. In fact, she was deathly allergic. She did her best to avoid the lethal vegetables, but as popular as Kimble's crops were it was only a matter of time until she accidentally ate one. It killed her, of course. Heartbroken, Kimble tried to return to his own people. But the dwarves weren't just going to let him and his turnips leave. They threw him in prison and demanded he reveal the secrets of turnip farming, but that isn't something you can just teach. You either have the gift or you don't, and dwarves don't. In the end Kimble's frail body succumbed to the dwarves' torture and interrogation and he left to join his beloved in the afterlife. And that particular clan of dwarves discovered that turnip farmers were almost as tasty as the turnips themselves. Or so I've heard.~ []
@1068530 = ~Yes, Jan. I have already heard that tale, thank you.~ [MAZZ2510]
@1068535 = ~I am a druid, yes... and of course I would be happy to answer any of your questions, although that mischievous look of yours tells me I am about to be made fun of.~ [CERN2509]
@1068550 = ~I... I apologize, Sarevok. I know that there are reasons for your presence amongst us, but... you seem so unnatural to me that I cannot help but be repelled.~ [CERN2513]
@1068559 = ~That's exactly the kind of thing Twin-Hammers would say. He was a ruthless, savage, bloodthirsty outlaw who would kill anyone or anything that got in his way. He used to repeatedly terrorize a certain gnomish village he frequently wandered through in his never ending quest for profit and bloodshed.~ []
@1068565 = ~Ah. I have given that considerable thought, actually.~ []
@1068575 = ~Alas, Uriah met his end in that street. With his first blow he broke his hammer on Hackman's shield, and that was it. Weaponless, he wasn't much of a match for the mighty Clint. If my uncle had only been named Twin-Hammer because he carried two weapons he might still be alive today. But Uriah got his nickname for the mighty hammer he carried in his belt and the even mightier... uh, 'hammer' he had *beneath* his belt, if you get my drift. A fine instrument to have, but not much good in a fight.~ []
@1068591 = ~It's not you personally, though I am concerned with the gadgets you are often fiddling with.~ [CERN2510]
@1068595 = ~Ah, Viconia my dusky jewel... I was merely admiring your natural grace, your striking beauty and your exotic voice. You could surely have made a fine career on the stage.~ []
@1068609 = ~Oh? 'Tis not so at all. I find all of this a marvel to behold, indeed. 'Twould be rare to find something to compare even on the planes.~ []
@1068613 = ~Only through destruction and death is rebirth possible, my dove. 'Tis the natural way of things.~ []
@1068614 = ~It's not *natural* to cheer it on, to hasten the process! You have to fight against that kind of evil, Haer'Dalis! To not do so would be... unthinkable!~ []
@1068615 = ~And who says such a process is evil? 'Tis a narrow view you've founded for yourself, my dove, though not unexpected. Perhaps with experience and travel your eyes will be opened a little.~ []
@1068616 = ~I... see. I knew we were different, my bard... but not this different.~ []
@1068620 = ~Oh... I was just thinking about Saradush. All those poor people! Killed because of some power-hungry Bhaalspawn! All that anguish, I just can't believe it!~ [AERI2524]
@1068621 = ~Aye, 'tis a wonder to behold, is it not?~ []
@1068623 = ~I understand your sympathy for the townsfolk, my dove, and I love you for it all the more. But 'tis nothing to shy one's gaze from. Entropy is a good thing... the forces we are witnessing are completely enthralling...~ []
@1068627 = ~Yes, it does! You... you would not only advocate that Saradush's destruction was a good thing, you would say that we should *assist* in its destruction! The more the better!~ []
@1068628 = ~But shall your shining example not guide us down the proper path, Sir Keldorn?~ []
@1068629 = ~My assistance was not required in this case, but in essence you are correct. All things are torn down to create the new. 'Tis a cycle that we are part of and must accept.~ []
@1068630 = ~I am not the leader of this group... though even if I were I do not know if it would make a difference. No matter what path <CHARNAME> chooses, I fear it will be a journey awash in blood.~ []
@1068632 = ~But... my love, are you sure that --~ []
@1068649 = ~Ahh, Imoen, my wildflower. Have I ever told you that you've a most natural grace and innocent beauty about you? 'Tis something any man would find most charming.~ [HAER2505]
@1068651 = ~'Twas not meant as such. I've no intention of offending you.~ []
@1068653 = ~'Tis only that I see you in an unguarded moment, at times... and I see the ache in your heart reflected in your eyes. It saddens this sparrow to know there is no-one to hold you close, Imoen.~ []
@1068658 = ~Yes, I know. 'Tis an art form that has served this sparrow well, at times.~ []
@1068662 = ~Oh! Well, no... uh... I just thought...~ [IMOE2519]
@1068663 = ~Then I shall thank you for the compliment... though I still think it rude to stare.~ []
@1068716 = ~It turned out that dust demons gossip a lot, and their tale of Winthrop's nightly goat milk had spread. So along comes this three-armed Baalor (there's a longer story about why the Baalor had only three arms, and besides the fact that he was nicknamed 'Smart Mouth' by the greater powers in the Abyss I won't go into it any more than that) who flies into Candlekeep in the middle of the night and storms his way over to Winthrop's cell and drinks the milk. The Baalor, however, had misheard the gossip and thought that he was drinking the milk of a pregnant glabrezu. Don't ask me why.~ []
@1068722 = ~I just be tryin' to come to a reckoning about yer nature, ye walkin' ghost.~ [KORG2516]
@1068723 = ~Hmmmn. What happened to the Baalor?~ []
@1068731 = ~Hmph. Imoen, yer an o'er-lame excuse fer a member o' this party and I be tired of exertin' myself to protect ye! Next time I let ye perish, screaming like a ninny as ye does!~ [KORG2505]
@1068732 = ~The last time I saw you exert yourself over anything was the last slab of pork at an inn. If you could keep up with me with that beer gut of yours I'd be amazed.~ [IMOE2520]
@1068749 = ~That'd be a neat trick, bringing change to all of Amn. Wouldn't those Roenalls still be a thorn for you, though? And what about the Cowled Wizards?~ []
@1068750 = ~I'm an archmage, Imoen... just like you. The Roenalls won't stop me from doing what I know is right. And I could always join the Cowled Wizards... how many of them are as powerful as I?~ []
@1068753 = ~Okay, somebody's getting a little scary...~ []
@1068755 = ~Even after my resurrection, violent rage pollutes my tainted blood. As <CHARNAME> can surely attest, it is a constant struggle to keep our bloodlust in check.~ []
@1068786 = ~Yer nothin' but a scrawny, whiny, stump-backed, miscastin' mage wanna be!~ []
@1068787 = ~I'm sick of your insults, you bastard! You're worth less than the feces of an unwashed kobold! You're stupid, bigoted, mean, small-minded and small-membered! Now leave me alone or I'll cast a spell of withering on that pathetic excuse for a manhood you're always scratching at between your legs!~ []
@1068794 = ~Forgive this sparrow's curiosity, my fierce hound, but my eyes are drawn of their own accord.  You have walked where every mortal must eventually go, though precious few return as you have.~ [HAER2514]
@1068797 = ~My experiences? Suffering, tiefling... suffering you cannot fathom. Each level of pain worse than the first, each layer of torment bringing new tortures.~ []
@1068861 = ~Do you think she would listen to us? You can trust a Turmish mage about as far as you can kick him... and even then it's not a bad idea to carry a good thumping stick. But, alas, Auntie Sara just cackled in her most villain-like way and was determined to carry on with her plan to hypnotize the Sword Coast. Alas, she was completely undone by an over-the-top exposition she gave to a spy that she had captured... and who subsequently escaped, of course, before she could have him killed. It's what villains do, I understand, when they're not busy defiling iron.~ []
@1068864 = ~Wait... this is just a joke to you, isn't it?~ []
@1068879 = ~Ah, yes. I know the fellow. Handsome young gnome, apple of his mother's eye. Wealthy, debonair, beloved by all. Your stepfather was a fortunate man to have met him.~ []
@1068886 = ~No doubt. I've been saving some rather excruciating torture techniques for the occasion.~ []
@1068888 = ~It's been a grand fight, eh mage? Can you better cap a life than with blood betwixt the toes and the flames of hell itself! Ha ha!~ [KORG2509]
@1068890 = ~Would someone get this bile-soaked freak away from me?~ [EDWI2509]
@1068892 = ~Ye think yer healin' powers make ye indispensable, drow? I wonder, can ye raise yerself from the dead if I slit yer dusky throat?~ []
@1068894 = ~Bah! Mages! Ye'll blast away from your mother's window but catch yer scatter-willies at the thought of blood. It's called follow-through! Feh!~ []
@1068895 = ~And why have you not already done so, Korgan? Like all your kind you lack the courage to act when you fear the consequences of failure. That is why the drow use your kin as slaves.~ []
@1068903 = ~Ah, great and future plans, but is not tomorrow uncertain? Could not the end of all just as likely occur today as in a millennium?~ []
@1068912 = ~Everything ends, Edwin. Everything dies. The dust of a god looks much the same as yours and mine will.~ []
@1068917 = ~(giggle!)  You're incorrigible, Jan.~ []
@1068935 = ~And slaves... have ye given much thought to slaves, <CHARNAME>? They'll do yer biddin' both in the bedroom and out.~ []
@1068952 = ~You have a venomous spider on your neck. A lovely creature, known to cause an agonizing, blood-curdling death within moments of injecting its nerve poison.~ []
@1068955 = ~You know, this reminds me of the time Uncle Scratchy laid me flat with the handle of a horseman's flail. 'Look behind you!', he says. 'Why? What's behind me?', I say. 'A Tiberian Dung Beetle!', he cries, looking frantic. So of course I scream in terror and look behind me... and lost a bag of the most scrumptious turnips ever to come out of Scornubel. Ma Jansen was furious and the lump was more painful than six weeks with the Calimshite Itch.~ []
@1068972 = ~I DON'T WANT TO -- eh? Wait a minute, that's a fly. A dead fly. You mean I ripped off my own shirt for nothing?~ []
@1068981 = ~What's that in your gaze, Edwin? You have something to say?~ [VALY2505]
@1068984 = ~Spit your bile in my direction if you must, but consider that it was your own machinations which caused your first death. Fail to learn from that and you will die again with as little meaning.~ []

@1070164 = ~Your words are noble, but naive. Our love is everything to me, <CHARNAME>. But what is that in the face of your destiny? You are a shaper of history, perhaps even someday you will become a god. Can you truly say you would give that all up for me?~ []
@1070166 = ~It is... something I have never said to you, before, because I was unsure if I truly felt that way. I have called you mrann d'sinss... lover... of my ssinssrigg... my love... but these are drow words.~ []
@1070187 = ~I do not revel in the deaths of the innocent, <CHARNAME>. But the raw power unleashed on the city - did it not make your skin tingle? Could you not feel a charge in the air?~ []

@1070194 = ~Of course there is danger with such intoxication. It can be addictive. We must be careful not to let bloodlust and battle glory blind us to the true horror of what we have witnessed. I suppose that is the sinister seductiveness of power.~ []
@1070197 = ~Truly, my love... I cannot even imagine what this must be like for you - one who has the power of a god in her veins. I am glad we were able to discuss this, though I feel there is much we both need to think on.~ []
@1070213 = ~Death is truly a part of you, my lady. I know this.  And that is what troubles me. I feel the stir of battle churning my blood. The glory of a defeated foe at my feet thrills me. These feelings are not right, my love. They are dangerous,  as is our own power.~ []
@1070225 = ~You're pathetic, Anomen! Sniveling, weak and afraid of what my destiny will bring! You make me sick.~ []
@1070232 = ~*sigh*  Another awkward silence between us, my love. I fear I have not the words to entertain and amuse you as a proper courtier should.~ [ANOM2507]
@1070236 = ~Ah, perhaps the problem is mine. I was raised in a culture of chivalry; romance was an art, a craft of specific forms and patterns. Poetic professions of adoration and flattery were the expected ways for a knight to show his love.~ []
@1070244 = ~You are unlike any woman I have ever known, <CHARNAME>. With you, these platitudes of love cannot express my true feelings. And without them... I don't know what to say. I am like a warrior without armor or weapons:  vulnerable and defenseless.~ []
@1070248 = ~Then... then let me just say I love you, and leave it at that.~ []
@1070249 = ~*grin*  This is much easier, <CHARNAME> - I fear I have been wasting valuable energy in my efforts to elevate my speech to the language of love. Perhaps tonight you will be the beneficiary of my sudden extra reserves...~ []
@1070260 = ~Is there something you are trying to tell me, Anomen?~ []
@1070270 = ~We cannot possibly have a wedding now, not while the Bhaalspawn are being slaughtered all around us!~ []
@1070274 = ~Take this ring:  it was my sister's. I keep it near to remind me of her. It is not much, my lady, but let it serve as a sign of our love, and a symbol of our commitment to each other.~ []
@1070280 = ~Keep the ring near to your heart, my love. It shall bind us together when the forces of the world try to tear us apart. A single kiss to seal the deal, my lady...~ []
@1070283 = ~My love, I must talk to you. I sense we are nearing... well, in truth I do not know. But your destiny fast approaches. I feel an ending is near, a time of great consequence for you, and for us.~ [ANOM2509]
@1070289 = ~Truly I would like nothing more, my lady. But you cannot pretend things are anything but what they are.~ []
@1070290 = ~I... I want you to know that I will not stand in the way of your destiny, my love. Our love is the most important thing in my world,  more important than my family, my honor. Even my childhood dreams to join the Order seems insignificant beside my feelings for you.~ []
@1070292 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. Ah, <CHARNAME>... I am but a fool, struggling against the wisdom of the ages. What do I know? My words are nothing; they can only cause you distress at a time when you need to be most focused.~ []

The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry. A halberd is best described as a cross between a spear and an axe. This particular halberd is enchanted, gifted with an enhanced ability to slaughter foes.

Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on average. As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges, either by giving them longer staves or by increasing flexibility with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the long bow. This particular bow rivals any of its larger cousins: the magic inherent within it, whether a property of the wood itself or the result of a mage's enchantment, makes it more accurate than a normal bow.

Gargantua was self-proclaimed lord of his immeasurable lower regions until his son, Pantagruel, questioned the accuracy of the ruler. With his shortcomings exposed, great Gargantua lay prostrate upon the ground while Pantagruel sought to cover his cuirass in case his now governing body lost its sway. He was warned that the people would cut him no slacks, but he never listened, and had burned his britches behind him. Undaunted, he fulfilled his animus with the robes of his father, as uncomfortable as that might sound, and shaped the Metal "Unit" with his own hands. 

The rule of Pantagruel was a discommoding morass, his armor eventually suffering a breach in the breech that proved his undoing. As his basket left the pantry, so to speak, his regime fell to insurrection, and so complete was the sacking that not even his Metal "Unit" could be found. The component pieces, a pantaloon triumvirate, were lost in the annals of time. 

You now bear the awesome responsibility of the Metal "Unit". Gussets of wind, seams like reality, pockets of resistance, the seat of power, and legs as flared as your temper. Polish it well; the onus is now on you.

It has begun.

Even before I left Suldanessellar, the news had already begun pouring in from everywhere... tales of armies on the move, whole towns being destroyed to get at some lone wizard, massive carnage and destruction along the entire Sword Coast. It all links to the Bhaalspawn. They are being hunted, or hunting each other... whatever the case, wherever a Child of Bhaal is, violence soon follows. And so the fear and panic have spread, with any innocent even suspected of having the taint being driven from their homes or killed outright.

Even the elven lands are not immune, and I sensed considerable relief upon my departure from the very city that I helped save. Ellesime, at least, offered me some advice... there is a part of the old elven woods that house old ancestor spirits of the elves, spirits locked within giant carved faced made so long ago not even the elves remember when they were created. It is a sacred place reserved only for royalty, but Ellesime is allowing me to enter the dale and glean what wisdom I can.

I have gone alone... none of the elven forest folk want to be near me. And while no others are supposed to be here, I am sure that danger stalks me, yet. I should prepare my weapons and equipment and be ready for anything...~ []
@1073257 = ~Chapter 10

All has finally been revealed to me.

Bhaal is not returning. Perhaps he might have, if evil could be counted on to do as it is asked. Bhaal left the key to his resurrection with his High Priestess, and she has betrayed him, using all the power of the collected souls of Bhaal's dead children to turn herself into a goddess and leave Bhaal dead where he belongs.

Melissan tricked her former master, and she tricked me. She manipulated all the Bhaalspawn, even the members of the Five that she had collected secretly to kill the others. Even Balthazar who didn't trust her and intended to kill her.

I am the last of Bhaal's children... but even now Melissan holds most of the power that he once had. She is in the Abyss... and my only means of getting there was to destroy the pocket plane that I had unintentionally created. I am ready to face her, now.

There is no turning back.~ []
@1073258 = ~Chapter 9

Saradush has been sacked. Yaga-Shura had burst through the wall to find a Bhaalspawn... myself. I was not there, however, so he contented himself with destroying everything in his path, including all the other Children of Bhaal that had sought refuge, there.

Melissan survived, though she seemed devastated. I am one of the few Bhaalspawn that remain... the only others are a group comprised individually of the most powerful of Bhaal's children that remain in Faerun. They have been hunting their siblings, including me, but to what end even Melissan doesn't know. Perhaps they seek to raise Bhaal and become his earthbound avatars. Perhaps they seek to become gods themselves. But they will not rest until I am dead... and their powers combined are enough to destroy even me, so Melissan claims.

I have little choice but to take Melissan's offer of help. She knows of a safe haven in the Calimshite desert... a place called Amkethran... from which I can plan how best to confront these Bhaalspawn who hunt me and end all questions about my future and my destiny... whatever it may truly be... once and for all.~ []

An angel has brought me back to the Abyss to inform me, as far as I can tell, that my destiny as a Bhaalspawn is about to come to fruition. But I am not quite ready, it seems. My mind is not prepared to accept all the power of Bhaal's realm... and so it has created a demiplane of my very own, a cocoon by her description, in which I will have to prepare myself.

There's no obvious way out... it's not a very large place. And already uninvited guests from the neighborhood are showing up. My old enemy Sarevok, like a bad penny, turned up with a proposal... he will tell me how to get out of the demiplane, and whatever else he knows and is holding back, in return for the smallest slice of my soul to restore him to some semblance of life. I don't know how prepared I am to do that... I've had enough soul exchanges to last me several lifetimes. Perhaps I can find a way out on my own, we shall see.~ []
@1073856 = ~Sarevok in Hell: Part 2

An angel brought me back to the Abyss to inform me that my destiny as a Bhaalspawn is about to come to fruition. But I am not quite ready, it seems. My mind is not prepared to accept all the power of Bhaal's realm... and so it has created a demiplane of my very own, a 'cocoon' by her description, in which I will have to prepare myself.

None other than Sarevok himself turned up not moments after the angel's departure, and he had a deal in mind: in exchange for knowledge of how to leave the pocket plane as well as information on my destiny, he would be returned to life. I had little choice but to agree.~ []
@1073857 = ~The Challenges & the Fate Spirit

Sarevok informed me of two important facets of my pocket plane.

First are the challenges. I am not certain what form these will take, but there are five corridors that lead off from the main room, and somehow I am sure that they will open up as I am ready to face what is beyond. Sarevok implied that the challenges might be very difficult, and that I may want to consider acquiring back-up.

Which leads me to the 'fate spirit'. I am not sure how this spirit does what it does, but it seems I have some control over people whose fate is intertwined with my own. The fate spirit will summon companions for me... Baalors, but possible friends. To talk to the spirit, I need only interact with it near the 'entrance' to the plane.~ []
@1073859 = ~Meeting with Balthazar

I have finally met with Balthazar, the head of the monastic order in Amkethran, and while he was not exactly welcoming he did allow me to remain in the town so long as I did not attempt to enter the monastery or otherwise interfere in his business... and passed on to me the maps to the Bhaalspawn enclaves that Melissan presumably gave him.

Where Melissan is, now, appears to be a mystery. I am not entirely certain that this Balthazar is on the level. Regardless, there is no reason for me to try to get inside his fortress-like monastery and no way that I can see of doing so. My only path is to investigate the enclaves and confront the Bhaalspawn who are so intent on hunting me.~ []
@1073861 = ~Revelations of the Solar

The Solar has called me to my pocket plane once again, revealing some interesting facets of my past. When Gorion assaulted the Bhaalist temple and killed my mother, it could very easily have been that Sarevok was taken by the wizard instead of I. How would our paths have differed then, I wonder?

Gorion must have wanted this kept from me even beyond his death:  his final posthumous words to me that I read on my return to Candlekeep indicated that my mother was intimate with him, an innocent who was impregnated by Bhaal against her will, certainly not that she was one of Bhaal's faithful, willing to sacrifice me as a vessel of his essence to further his return. Perhaps Gorion knew that I would inevitably discover this in my own time, when I had matured enough to be able to accept the complete truth of my past, when the prophecies came to fruition.

While enlightening, it is hard to say what relevance such information has for me in my current situation. The Solar was cryptic, as usual... but she did open another of the doorways in the pocket plane that leads to another challenge. What lays beyond I shall have to discover for myself.~ []
@1073863 = ~Revelations of the Solar

Yet another interaction with the Solar... this time concerning my own place in Alaundo's prophecy. Supposedly, I am the one Alaundo spoke of, but in the way that I am supposed to stop the rest of the Bhaalspawn from wreaking destruction and chaos upon the Sword Coast... rather than being solely responsible for it, myself. I am unsure how to take this news, as it seems my place in the scheme of this is predestined. I could be the most savage beast in the Realms, and yet the other Bhaalspawn would still see me as a threat to them?

It seems that this is so. Whether I like it or not, I have been placed on a path to collide with the destinies of the remaining children of Bhaal. And it seems my victory would be far preferable to theirs... at least as far as the prophecy is concerned.

Once again, the Solar has opened another of the portals to a challenge in the pocket plane. There is more for me to learn about myself, yet, it appears.~ []
@1073864 = ~Revelations of the Solar

The powerful Bhaalspawn that I have been fighting, the ones that have been relentlessly hunting the others, call themselves 'the Five'. Like myself, they are the most potent of our kind and possess a great deal of Bhaal's divine essence.

It appears that they had gathered together for a single purpose... since they were too powerful to fight each other, they would combine their forces and hunt the remainder of the Bhaalspawn. Then they would raise our sire and become his earthly generals. They were largely successful, but four of them are now dead: Illasera, Yaga-Shura, Sendai and Abazigal.

The only trick is that they contained so much of Bhaal's essence that the god may be nearer to resurrection than ever. Perhaps that is what the last of the Five, Balthazar, plans even now. I have no choice but to return to Amkethran and stop him. Then, perhaps, this will finally all be over.

The fourth challenge room is now open to me. It seems odd, considering how close I am to the end, that there is still one more to go even after this.~ []
@1073865 = ~Revelations of the Solar

My course is set. My last enemy has been revealed. It is not Bhaal, arisen anew like I had suspected... it is none other than Melissan, and has been all along.

She was once Bhaal's high priestess during the Time of Troubles. It was supposed to be her in charge of killing all the Bhaalspawn and returning their essences to him... her in charge of Bhaal's resurrection. He trusted her and she has betrayed him. She has manipulated the Five to their deaths, manipulated me, and even now seeks to steal the power of her master and become a goddess.

The last of the challenges awaits me. I must enter that challenge and destroy my protective 'cocoon' that is my pocket plane so that I may enter the Throne of Bhaal to stop Melissan before she is successful. She MUST not succeed.~ []
@1073878 = ~Hey now, stranger. Just relax. We know what you Bhaalspawn are like. All we're doing is blowing off a little steam.~ []
@1073900 = ~Peragath the Valiant, a great champion of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, carried this shield into battle against a horde of invading Tanar'ri pouring through a gate to the Astral Plane. Gripped by holy fervor, the mighty paladin singlehandedly drove back the horde, then foolishly leapt through the Astral gate to finish them off. The gate collapsed, and both Peragath and the shield were forever lost in the Planes.

@1073916 = ~Aerie continued adventuring after leaving <CHARNAME>'s company, driven in her travels to oppose slavery in any form. Her compassion grew tainted by revenge, however; revenge for what had been taken when she was in chains. She might have lost herself entirely had she not stumbled across a group of Avariel winged elves enslaved in Cormyr. They compelled her to come to Faenya-Dale, the home she was originally stolen from, and she learned much while there. Most importantly, she learned she was no longer one of them, and stopped pining for wings she wouldn't use anyway. Aerie eventually became a high priestess in Understone, a gnomish village her mentor Quayle had sometimes spoken of. He had been her true family, and it was among his people that she finally found peace.~ []
@1073917 = ~Aerie and <CHARNAME> would prove inseparable, their adventuring careers becoming secondary to the raising of their son, and eventually a daughter as well. Their later years would hold one last great trek, however, as Aerie still suffered a sadness from her time enslaved and the loss of her wings. Together she and <CHARNAME> sought the Avariel of Faenya-Dale, the winged elves she was stolen from so long ago. They discovered not only her people, but loving parents that had spent years searching for their lost child. With no more mystery or confusion to cloud their lives, it was there, among the clouds, that Aerie and <CHARNAME> would finally be married. Their union, it is said, was blessed by visions of Aerdrie Faenya and Baervan Wildwanderer both.~ []
@1073918 = ~Nalia grew quite powerful after her association with <CHARNAME>. Initially she traveled, learning magical lore and making influential friends, but after a year she returned to Amn and her family home of de'Arnise Keep. She found it in the control of none other than Isaea Roenall, but she was no longer the wayward child that he expected, and single-handedly brought him to justice for his indiscretions. She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, becoming a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earning a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself. She would become a prominent figure in Amn for many years, constantly fighting for the good of the common folk and making many frustrated enemies among the nobility and Cowled Wizards both.~ []
@1073921 = ~No longer with <CHARNAME>, Viconia went on to found a cult dedicated to Shar in the city of Waterdeep. One of her followers betrayed her, however, prompting the slaughter of the whole tainted lot. Shar admonished Viconia strongly for this, but she was unrepentant and again wandered the Realms. Viconia was still formidable, and went on to prevent an attempt by the Knights of the Shield to take over Calimport, and even worked with Drizzt Do'Urden to save the elven city of Suldanessellar from a Zhentarim plot. For this last act, the elves accepted her, and Queen Ellesime bestowed the highest honors of the Seldarine, an accolade never before given to one of her dark kind. Viconia reportedly bowed once without emotion, and then left. Her fate remains unknown.~ []
@1073922 = ~<CHARNAME> and Viconia continued adventuring long after leaving Tethyr. He became an important political figure, and she was his trusted counsel. Eventually Viconia bore <CHARNAME>'s child, which first served to strain their relationship. The birth, however, changed her, and she dedicated herself to raising the boy, teaching him both the ways of the drow and of <CHARNAME>'s people. She marveled at the understanding in his eyes, but, unfortunately, didn't live to see him grow. Viconia was poisoned by a servant of Lolth, her last words whispered to her loving mate in private. <CHARNAME> raised his son in secret, and tales vary on the result. Some say they waged a crusade against the drow, but all agree that the former child of Bhaal never forgot the love of his dark maiden.~ []
@1073924 = ~Haer'Dalis found traveling with <CHARNAME> a fine introduction to the Realms, and once they parted company he was eager to see more. He visited such varied locales as Waterdeep, Neverwinter, and Thay, eventually fleeing each one after innocently immersing himself in local troubles. Later he would befriend a female Cambion and return with her to the Abyss, only to unintentionally end up leading a revolt on several layers of the hells. For a time, Haer'Dalis was the most-hunted man among the planes, but the ire of his enemies could not match his wanderlust, and he eventually found his way back to the city of Sigil unharmed in any permanent fashion. There he rejoined Raelis' acting troupe and was pleased to finally settle down - until the next misunderstanding, of course.~ []
@1073927 = ~With the saga of the Bhaalspawn closed, Minsc fulfilled a long promised oath. He returned to Rasheman, hoping to regale the Icedragon Berserker Lodge with the tales of his deeds, and earn a place within its hallowed halls. His words were not needed. Every tavern in Faerun had a bard singing of the valiant ranger, and he was welcomed as a hero. Eventually he formed his own adventuring company, the Justice Fist, striking fear in the hearts and faces of evil until, in his advancing age, he again set out across the Realms... and disappeared. And what of Boo? Well, what is Minsc without Boo? The two would never be separated, and some say they are together still, up amongst the stars where hamsters are giants and men become legends.~ []
@1073946 = ~Elminster's Ecologies: Appendix IIIa

This time-worn tome is written by the sage Elminster, and apparently part of a much larger body of work containing detailed studies of most of the strange creatures from around Faerun. 

The appendix seems to refer to newly-discovered variations on normal breeds of creatures. Of particular interest:

"Dense Puddings - a relative of the slimes and molds, this pudding is relatively normal... except when exposed to electricity or fire. When this occurs, it splits into new puddings and can therefore be very dangerous."

"Fire Trolls - a new form of troll thought to have been created by sorcerous Fire Giants for use as servants and guards. They are similar to regular trolls in most respects except for their lava-temperature skin and burning touch. Once they are defeated, they can only be permanently killed by cold or acid."

"Fission Slime - an off-shoot of the slimes and molds, this particular slime will split into new and independent creatures when hit. It is vulnerable to fire, which will kill it permanently."

"Magic Golems - this rare type of golem is formed from pure magical energy and is completely immune to spellcraft as well as enchanted weapons. To my knowledge, only weapons without enchantments have any effects on this creature."

"Marileths - while this is apparently a legitimate form of demon, it is one that only an exceptional few have encountered and survived. The Marileth is a six-armed demon with a human female front half and the back half of a snake. She is incredibly quick and deadly, and on top of her martial prowess with six swords, she casts spells as well. Fighters should beware: in addition to being immune to normal weapons and minor enchantments, this demon also likes to cast Immunity to Magic Weapons... which must be dispelled if a fighter is to have any chance with his armaments."~ []
@1073958 = ~The Ghostly Apparition

I encountered a spirit of an old man in the prison. He is unable to communicate, but is obviously trying to. From what I can gather, his gravesite has been defiled in some manner. Perhaps some elven holy water or something similar would put this spirit at peace... although he also seems to be miming for some kind of necklace... or perhaps it's something to do with his head... as well.~ []
@1073960 = ~Meeting Volo

I met the infamous historian, Volo, in Saradush... quite a different meeting from out first encounter long ago and far to the north. Volo is busy writing a book about me and my adventures and told me a little about what he planned. An odd feeling, to say the least, to be immortalized so.~ []
@1073961 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

A man by the name of Peltje was babbling about a group of vampires in the city masquerading as protitutes. They base in the sewers, apparently, and might serve as a way to get inside the sewers... if a dangerous one. Then again, this Peltje could be as insane as he claims he isn't.~ []

@9910811 = ~CAUTION!
Dual-classing is a significant change to your character. Please be sure you have read and understand the following, as well as the description given in the manual. 

Dual-classing is an ability that only humans have. It is the process by which you stop advancing in your current class and begin advancing in a second class. You will retain the benefits and abilities of the first class at its current level, but from then on you will only gain experience in the second. 
In order to become dual-classed you must be of at least 2nd level in your current class. Your character must have scores of 15 or higher in the prime requisites of your current class, and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of the class you wish to change to. Some classes cannot be combined due to alignment conflicts or inherent restrictions. Within Baldur's Gate II all resulting mixes must be viable multi-class combinations as well.

Dual-class characters have much the same requirements as multi-class characters. You must abide by the restrictions of the individual classes. For example: a Mage combination cannot cast spells while wearing armor, a Thief combination cannot use thieving skills wearing other than leather or elven chain armors, and a Cleric or Druid combination cannot use weapons that their ethos does not allow.

When you gain a level, you will have the option to change to a second class, provided you have the prerequisites and do not have any alignment conflicts. Your first class becomes "inactive" and you begin again at 1st level with 0 experience points in your second class. From then on you progress as a single-classed character in your new class. ONCE YOU HAVE CHANGED TO A SECOND CLASS YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO THE FIRST. Your first class will forever remain at its current level.

You will be unable to use the abilities of your first class until you have attained ONE LEVEL HIGHER in your new class. For example: If you were a 10th level mage and switched to a fighter, you would not be able to use your mage abilities again until you reached 11th level as a fighter

IMPORTANT: The experience cap in Baldur's Gate II is 8,000,000 points for a single character. Experience points from BOTH of a dual-classed character's classes count towards this total. Please be sure that there are sufficient points left available to allow you to progress high enough in your second class! IF YOU ARE LEVEL 23 IN YOUR CURRENT CLASS, IT IS VERY LIKELY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REACH LEVEL 24 IN A SECOND CLASS. The game will still allow you to dual if you wish, but you may not be able to access your previous class' abilities within Baldur's Gate II. This may result in difficulty later in the game. Consult your manual's experience point table if required.~ []

@9938608 = ~This flail has been in the care of Lord de'Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiates when assembled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity with magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

@9939571 = ~On his deathbed, aged hero Rigar Trueblood begged one last request of his mage companion Spectorial: that his skill and fortitude as a warrior live on. The reluctant friend consented and transferred these traits to an item, knowing the warrior's soul would then be lacking them. This pale green ioun stone now holds these essences, and grants the owner Trueblood's health and skill.

@9945055 = ~Earthquake (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Level: 7
Range: 120 yds.
Duration: 3 tremors
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by a priest, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect.

There are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake. The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6d6 points of damage (save vs. spell at a -6 penalty for half damage). Those who fail their saving throws fall to the ground for four rounds.

The second tremor is less severe, causing 3d6 points of damage (save for half at a -2 penalty). The final tremor causes 2d6 damage (save for half).

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use. Finally, Earth Elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear. This elemental will attack the party.~
@9945867 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

Monks must be of Lawful alignments.

Advantages:
-  The monk can make 1 unarmed attack per round, and gains 1/2 an additional attack every 3 levels to a maximum of 4 attacks per round at level 18.
-  The damage inflicted by the monk's fists goes up as as the monk increases in levels:
Level 1-2:  1-6
Level 3-5:  1-8
Level 6-8:  1-10
Level 9-14:  1-12
Level 15+: 1-20
-  A monk's natural armor class gets better as the monk goes up in levels. Armor class starts off at 9, and then decreases by 1 for every 2 levels until level 21, then every 3 levels until 30, then every 5 levels until 40.
-  Stunning blow, once per day for every 4 levels. All attacks in the next 6 seconds force the victim to save or be stunned. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  Monks have the Deflect Missiles ability. This gives them a -1 to their AC vs missiles for every 3 levels.
-  The monk gains a +2 to save vs spells
-  A monk starts off moving at +2 move, then +1 move every 5 levels.
-  5th level:  Immunity to all diseases, and cannot be Slowed or Hasted.
-  7th level:  Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level
-  8th level:  -1 to speed factor
-  9th level:  +1 to all saves. Immune to charm. The monk's fist is considered a +1 weapon (+2 at 12th, +3 at 15th, +4 at 25th)
-  11th level:  Immune to poison
-  12th level:  Another -1 to speed factor.  Fists are considered +2 weapons. 
-  13th level:  Quivering palm spell once per day. This spell gives one hand attack. If an opponent is struck, the opponent must Save Vs. Death or die. NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  14th level:  The monk gains 3% innate magic resistance per level (starting a 42% at 14th level, and reaching a maximum of 78%)
-  15th level:  Fists are considered +3 weapons
-  20th level:  Immune to non-magical weapons
-  25th level:  Fists are considered +4 weapons

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear any armor
-  May not use the off-hand in combat, so may only use one-handed weapons available to the thief class, may not carry a shield, and may not dual-wield (use a second melee weapon.)~ []
@9945869 = ~BARBARIAN: A barbarian can be an excellent warrior. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly be thrown into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent.

Advantages:
-  Moves at 2 points faster than the normal character movement rate
-  Immunity to backstab
-  Can rage once per day per every 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use). Rage gives +4 to constitution and strength for 5 rounds. Gives a 2 point armor class penalty and +2 to saves vs magic (for 5 rounds). Rage also gives immunity to all charm, hold, fear, maze, confusion and level drain spells.
-  At 11th level the barbarian gains 10% resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing and missile damage, and gains a further +5% to this at levels 15 and 19.
-  The barbarian rolls d12 for hit points instead of a fighter's d10.

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear full plate or plate mail armors.
-  Cannot specialize in weapons past normal specialization (two proficiency points.)~ []
