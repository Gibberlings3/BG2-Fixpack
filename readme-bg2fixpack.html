<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> compilation
    of fixes for Baldur's Gate II. With the disappearance of Kevin Dorner and
    the cessation of activity of the Baldurdash fixpack for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
    several modders began working on a new <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> fixpack
    to address the numerous bugs that have been identified since Baldurdash.
    This collaborative effort, including the work of modders from several different
    modding communities and assistance from <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> lead
    writer David Gaider, has resulted in a fixpack that currently includes all
    of the fixes addressed by Baldurdash (including the Game Text Update) and
    several hundred new bugfixes. The project is ongoing, and we're working through
    a substantial list of bugs culled from various sites, the old Baldurdash
    forums, and our own research. </p>
  <p>Though the project has now left beta behind, there remains a need to introduce
    and test new fixes. To facilitate these new fixes without compromising the
    stability of the project, a component entitled <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong> is
    available. This component includes fixes intended for the Core Fixes component
    and tested in a limited fashion, but have not yet been tested 'in the wild'
    or with other mods. <strong>As such, this component is considered to be of
    a BETA status.</strong> As fixes in this component get tested and validated
    in the wild, they will move into the Core Fixes. </p>
  <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack strives for complete transparency  in its fixes. As such, <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">complete documentation</a> is available of the fixes on the project pages, visual fixes are noted in the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?app=gallery&amp;album=26"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack Gallery</a>, and  all discussions leading up to fixes are in the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=74">Fixpack forums</a>. There are no  private workrooms. </p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Fixpack is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II with or without the
    Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. <strong>In terms of installation order, the
    Fixpack should be installed after the official patches, but before other
    mods. Do not install the Fixpack alongside other fixpacks such as Baldurdash. </strong>There
    is a <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=3693">compatibility
    and redundancy thread</a> in the Fixpack forums for the most recent information; these are the known incompatibilities and redundancies as of v10:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Baldurdash or any other previous fixpack</strong> - 
      We used the bug lists from previous efforts to fix bugs as a starting point.
      If the bugs aren't already fixed by the Fixpack they will be in future
      versions. Installing Baldurdash alongside Fixpack will result in a lot
      of issues. </li>
    <li><strong>Tutu</strong> - 
      The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack is not built for installation on Tutu games. Macready's Easytutu has incorporated several relevant fixes from Fixpack; for traditional Tutu games there will likely be installation errors that prevent 
      installation of the Fixpack.</li>
    <li> <strong>D0Tweak</strong> - 
      The 'Corrected Demon Animations' component is included in the core fixes.
      'Corrected Summoned Demon Behavior' and 'Ghrey's Holy Symbol Fix' are included
      as Optional But Cool components.</li>
    <li> <strong>Ease of Use</strong> - 
      Ease of Use is deprecated by the more modern (and actively supported) <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweak/"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks</a>. If you insist, however, note that the Edwina Portrait component
      from Ease of Use will overwrite our Edwin/Edwina 'gliding animation' fixes.
      This is not the case with the same component from <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks. </li>
    <li><strong>LuvNalia</strong> - 
      Sir Billy Bob's repackaged Nalia romance will report errors when trying to
      patch ar2904.bcs. These are non-fatal errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Oversight</strong> - 
      The 'Alignment Corrections' component was used as a basis for the alignment
      changes in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack, making them semi-redundant. 'Improved Continuity'
      is included except for the Saemon Havarian bits; it should be safe to install
      if you want to get the extra Saemon material.</li>
    <li> <strong>Quest Pack</strong> - 
      The Revised Hell Trials component will generate warnings if the <acronym title="Optional But Cool">OBC</acronym> Additional
      Script Fixes component from Fixpack is installed. A <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=8676">workaround</a> is
      available.</li>
    <li><strong>The Bigg Tweak Pack</strong>- 
      The Unlimited Limited Wish and Wish component is included in the core fixes. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack is packaged and
    installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a bg2fixpack folder and setup-bg2fixpack.exe
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install,
    simply double-click setup-bg2fixpack.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-bg2fixpack.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac <acronym title="Operating System 10">OS X</acronym></strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em> The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2 </acronym>Fixpack
    is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have a bg2fixpack folder, setup-bg2fixpack,
    and setup-bg2fixpack.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-bg2fixpack.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Download the latest version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> for
    Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract
    (at least) the <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>,
    weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal, cd to your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.</p>
  <p> You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini)
    if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the
    archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option
    (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since
    the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both
    options is the safe bet.</p>
  <p> After that, run 'weinstall bg2fixpack' from your game installation directory
    to install or uninstall the mod. </p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack is basically
    four items: core fixes, a game text update, beta core fixes,
    and several optional but cool fixes. Optional But Cool is broken down further
    into individual components. </p>
  <p><strong><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack (Core Fixes) </strong><br />
    This component includes all fixes deemed to be core by the Fixpack team.
    While some bugs are clearly bugs, the team also has a review process for
    'gray area' bugs to insure that fixes do not contradict developer intent.
    The result is a 'core fixes' component which aims to address true bugs
    only and in a manner consistent with BioWare's original goals. When we
    encounter something we happen to think is a bug (or just strange behavior)
    but appears to be intentional, we generally fix those as an Optional But
    Cool component. <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/docs_core.php">Complete
    documentation</a> is available on the <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> web site. Additionally, the complete <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=74">Fixpack
    forums</a> are open, so if you want to see the reasoning behind a bugfix
    (or tell us we've got it all wrong), please join us on the forums and provide
    feedback. If you find a bug that is not fixed and is not in our <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=92">Pending
    Fixes</a> forum, please report it. </p>
  <p><strong>Game Text Update </strong><br />
    <em>English Only </em><br />
    This component, based upon the Baldurdash Game Text Update, seeks to
    address miscellaneous errors in the text. Typos, grammatical errors,
    item description inconsistencies, etc. are addressed by this component.
    It should be noted that incorrect text that is actually a bug is
    addressed by Core Fixes. The Game Text Update can&nbsp;be installed in
    two ways. The first (and recommended) option will install &quot;<acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> Light&quot;
    (by Wisp), a fairly minimalistic dialogue update which contains only
    the most relevant typographical corrections. The second option will
    install &quot;<acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> Classic&quot; (from Baldurdash, by Kevin Dorner), an in-depth
    dialogue revision, parts of which may be considered arbitrary by
    purists. </p>
  <p class="deprecated"><strong>Super Happy Fun Lucky Modder Pack</strong><br />
    This component has been discontinued due to lack of interest. </p>
  <p><strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong><br />
    Though the Fixpack has long since left beta, new fixes still need to be added. This
    component includes fixes intended for the Core Fixes component and tested
    in a limited fashion, but have not yet been tested 'in the wild' or with
    other mods. <strong>As such, this component is considered to be of a BETA
    status.</strong> As fixes in this component get tested and validated in
    the wild, they will move into the Core Fixes. These fixes are <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/docs_core.php">shown in red on the documentation page</a>. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Party Gets <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> for
    Sending Keldorn to Reconcile With Maria</strong><br />
    In Keldorn's personal quest, if you go with Keldorn when he reconciles with
    Maria the party receives <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym>.
    However, if you send him alone to reconcile you do not--this component gives
    you <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> for sending him alone
    to reconcile. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Improved Spell Animations</strong><br />
    This component alters the animations of several spells, including Maze, by
    addressing subtle errors in their animation cycles. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Cromwell's Forging Actually Takes a Day</strong><br />
    When Cromwell forges an item for the party, he says it will take a day but
    no actual time passes. This component changes the upgrades to actually
    take a day. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Mixed-Use Dagger Fixes</strong><br />
    Daggers that can be used in melee and thrown are an irresolvable bug: when
    thrown, daggers should get an extra attack per round, but there's no way
    to apply this bonus without also granting it when he dagger is being used
    in melee. This component grants the extra attack but at the expense of
    removing melee abilities. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Ghreyfain's Holy Symbol Fixes</strong><br />
    Basically, it makes the granting of Holy Symbols in the game a bit more logical.
    Aerie gets the symbol of Baervan, Viconia gets the symbol of Shar, and
    Anomen gains the symbol of Helm even when lawful good (he used to get Lathander's).</p>
  <p class="deprecated"><strong>Optional But Cool: Additional Hero Quests in Trademeet Wait Until
    Hero is Officially Named (DEPRECATED)</strong><br />
    This was confirmed by BioWare as an actual bug and has been moved into the core fixes. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Giants Receive Penalties When Attacking Halflings,
    Dwarves, and Gnomes</strong><br />
    This component gives giants their <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> penalty
    when trying to attack undersized (halflings, dwarves, gnomes) foes. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Remove Dual-Classing Restriction from Archers
    and Stalkers</strong><br />
    In Throne of Bhaal, archers and stalkers can't dual-class to clerics as
    normal rangers and beastmasters can; for consistency Core Fixes adds this
    restriction to <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>-only games as
    well. This component will remove the restriction.</p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Remove Second Attribute Bonus for Evil Path in
    Wrath Hell Trial</strong><br />
    If the protagonist selects the 'evil' option when speaking to Sarevok in
    the Hell Trials, the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> gets rewarded twice with attribute bonuses. There
    are several factors that suggest one of the bonuses is leftover junk in the
    script, but there's not enough evidence of developer intent to include it
    in the Core Fixes. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Corrected Summoned Demon Behavior</strong><br />
    This component alters the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of
    summoned demons, causing them to behave less predictably, but at the same
    time, more realistically (i.e. Baatezu will attack Tanar'ri). </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Additional Script Fixes</strong><br />
    There are several additional scripting errors which can't be fixed by the
    core fixes. While clearly bugs, what was intended by the developers is
    more towards speculation and, as such, these fixes have been moved into
    their own component. Most of the bugs are missing checks in spellcaster
    scripts for memorized spells (or casting spells). A more detailed account
    of the changes can be found in the full <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/docs_core.php">Optional
    But Cool documentation</a>. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Bard Song Fixes<br />
    </strong>The manual describes bard's Battlesong as granting &quot;morale and luck
    improvement for the party.&quot; And then goes on to describe a luck <i>bonus</i> for
    the party as though it were a luck <i>penalty</i> for opponents. And then
    in-game battlesong grants only immunity to fear (without preventing the additional
    effects that can accompany fear) with no morale or luck effects at all. Our
    best educated guess at developer intent adds a +1 luck bonus to battlesong,
    which improves to +2 at 15th level and improves again to +3 at 20th level.
    Blade's version of battlesong in this component still does not improve with
    levels (as the class disadvantage states) and Skald and Jester songs (which
    already vaguely match their descriptions and work) are untouched.</p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Wizard Slayers Cause Miscast Magic on Ranged
    Attacks<br />
    </strong>The original kit description of the Wizard Slayer states as a kit
    advantage: &quot;For each successful hit on an opponent, 10% cumulative spell
    failure penalty is applied&quot;. However, it was only applying this effect
    on melee hits. The Core Fixes do not change this and the Game Text Update
    clarifies the kit description to specify melee-only. This component allows
    players to extend the ability to both melee and ranged attacks and updates
    the kit description. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Additional Alignment Fixes <br />
    </strong>As part of the Core Fixes, the Fixpack addresses many creatures
    who either lack alignment, have conflicting alignments between their creature
    files, or have an alignment completely at odds with their behavior. These
    changes underwent a great deal of scrutiny in an organized review, and it
    was decided that some of them should be moved into an optional component
    as there was no general consensus for the new alignments of these specific
    creatures. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Change Free Action to Protect Against Stun</strong> <br />
    BioWare was very inconsistent about whether free action should protect against
    stun or not. The spell did not protect against it, but most items that
    grant free action did. However, per David Gaider, free action is not supposed
    to protect against stun. For players who think this overpowers stun (particularly
    mind flayer psionics) this component will extend free action to protect
    against stun. </p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Paws from Shapeshifting Can
    Not Be Dispelled</strong><br />
    <em>Windows-only, requires TobEx</em><br />
    <!--
	Dispel magic effects always dispel magically created weapons, such as energy
      blades, black baldes of disaster, or the paws of shapeshifter druids. In
      the last case the form is not dispellable, so it leaves the shapeshifter
      in werewolf form but able to use normal weapons. This component makes these
      items not subject to a dispel magic. This should be a core fix, but because
      it causes the animation cycles to constantly reset which, though purely
  cosmetic, can be distracting and unwanted. 
  --> 
    Dispel magic will no longer remove the paws of shapeshifted creatures.</p>
  <p><strong>Optional But Cool: Remove Thieving Start Bonuses from Bard and Ranger Skills</strong> <br />
    All thieving skills use one lookup table to determine their racial bonuses for their abilities. However, the table is actually a combination of racial bonuses and initial thieving abilities. This component seeks to remove the initial thief bonuses from non-thief classes. Specifically, bards will no longer receive a 15% bonus to their pickpocket skills, and rangers will not receive the 7% bonus to stealth.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are a couple of folks we would like to single out for
    acknowledgement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>David Gaider:</strong> Officially credited as a member of the
      'core design team' for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
      David's probably better described as the head writer. David was kind enough
      to answer questions regarding developer intent with respect to several
      fixes. </li>
    <li><strong>devSin:</strong> An excellent right-hand man, whose intimate
      knowledge of arcane engine details helped us identify and solve a huge
      number of bugs. </li>
    <li><strong>Nythrun:</strong> An angel who's come out of nowhere to help
      with just about everything. </li>
    <li><strong>DavidW, </strong><strong>Wisp &amp; aVENGER:</strong> These three stepped in after much of the original team had moved on, and led the project through four additional releases</li>
    <li><strong>Wes Weimer and the bigg:</strong> Such an effort wouldn't even
      be possible without a tool like <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
      In particular, the new patching abilities of the last 20-30 versions have
      made a huge number of really nifty things possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Kish and SimDing0:</strong> Often the two counterpoints to determining
      what needed to be fixed and how, their input was invaluable. </li>
    <li><strong>Kevin Dorner:</strong> We tried to recruit Kevin for the project
      but never got a response. Nonetheless, the bug list (both fixed and pending)
      from Baldurdash was a huge aid when we developed our own fixes.</li>
    <li><strong>igi and the <acronym title="Infinity Engine Structures Description Project">IESDP</acronym> contributors:</strong> The <acronym title="Infinity Engine Structures Description Project">IESDP</acronym> was
      invaluable for a project of this scope. igi, as the maintainer, and the
      various <a href="http://iesdp.gibberlings3.net/credits.htm"><acronym title="Infinity Engine Structures Description Project">IESDP</acronym> contributors</a> also
      deserve credit. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thanks as well to yarpen for the Polish translation, Leonardo Watson for
    the German translation, Immortality and Clan DLAN (with revisions from Ghildrean)
    for the Spanish translation, Anomaly for the French translation, web2air
    for the Korean translation,  Andrea C. for the Italian translation, and good0593 for the Chinese translations.</p>
  <p>Versions 7-8 of the Fixpack were coded by DavidW, in consultation
    with devSin and using code and observations by Nythrun, aVENGER,
    Taimon, Wisp, ScuD, Icendoan and Mike1072. Version 9 was coded by
    aVENGER, in consultation with devSin, using code and observations by
    Nythrun,&nbsp;Wisp and Jason Compton. Version 10 is primarily an aVENGER-Wisp-CamDawg project, with the usual assistance from the folks on the Fixpack forums.</p>

<h2>Distribution note</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
    more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
    hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
    get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
  <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
    work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
    from the author(s). </p>
  <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>

<h2>Version History</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Version 10 - April 14, 2013</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Version 10 was put together with the hard work of aVENGER and Wisp and is a major update</li>
    <li>Added Chinese (traditional and simplified) translation, thanks good0593!</li>
    <li><strong>Game Text Update: <acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> Light</strong> has been updated with the latest from Wisp</li>
    <li>The <strong>Super Happy Fun Lucky Modder Pack</strong> was deprecated due to a lack of interest. Modders who are interested in using anything from it can find the contents in the library modder.tpa in the lib folder.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with the <strong>Optional But Cool: Cromwell's Forging Actually Takes a Day</strong> component not playing nice with others</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>Optional But Cool: Bard Song Fixes</strong> where the blade and regular bard songs were  swapped</li>
    <li><strong>Optional But Cool: Improved Spell Animations</strong> now changes Errard's divination spell to use a divination casting graphic</li>
    <li><strong>Optional But Cool: Mixed-Use Dagger Fixes</strong> no longer changes Firetooth's damage</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented BETA Core Fixes from installing without <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym></li>
    <li>Documentation was completely reworked, with an eye to making the changes more understandable to players:
      <ul>
        <li>Players no longer have to wade through all tedious file names and notes for modders (these are still available for modders, though)</li>
        <li>Core Fixes and BETA Core Fixes have been combined into a single document</li>
        <li>Overall efforts have been made to make the descriptions a lot more player-friendly</li>
        <li>Wherever possible, bugfixes have been consolidated for brevity and concision, even though this means the loss of such great fix titles as <em>You Can't Hope to Stop Habib, You Can Only Hope to        Contain Him</em></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?app=gallery&amp;album=26"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack Gallery</a> has been restored so players can see some of the visual fixes</li>
        <li>Fixes from v9 were never documented</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The following changes were made to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Core Fixes</span> component:
      <ul>
        <li>Several fixes had been lingering, some for years, in the Core Fixes BETA component and have finally been promoted into the Core Fixes</li>
        <li>The range and magic resistance fixes for Detect Evil were erroneously changing Moon Dog Sight to affect party-only</li>
        <li><em>Elven and Half-Elven Resistance to Sleep and Charm</em> was being a little too generous with its protection, i.e. it no longer protects against psionics</li>
        <li>The secondary spells created in Blade Spin Fixes no longer create spurious messages in the feedback window</li>
        <li>Closed an exploit that allowed the player to bypass most of the City of Caverns plot</li>
        <li>The <em>Incorrect Lines in Dialogues</em> no longer destructively patches player1.dlg and instead plays nicely with others</li>
        <li>Getting Gaal to take the rift part as part of the <em>Unseeing Eye <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> Exploit, Quest
          Breakage</em> fix was causing additional issues and was rolled back</li>
        <li><em>Duplicate Stores</em> was not actually accounting for all duplicate gem bags</li>
        <li>Clearing out Flydian after Trademeet was saved was inexplicably causing crashes on <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>-only games</li>
        <li>The <em>Brynnlaw Vampire Attack May Prevent Quest From Advancing</em> fix was causing some issues with Saemon and has been revised</li>
        <li>Dialogues looking for Faldorn's death variable are corrected</li>
        <li>The <em>Staff of the Magi Errors</em> fix was  removing the Protection from Evil icon in the course of its repairs</li>
        <li>The <em>Azuredge Axe Corrupted, Other Errors</em> fix was redone to really, really fix it this time, honest</li>
        <li>The  'touched up' icon introduced for the Borok's Fist  had a pink shadow; the icon that ships with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> is now used instead</li>
        <li>The Emphatic Manifestation is no longer changed to demonic as part of the creature racial fixes</li>
        <li>English sounds were being restored in non-English games</li>
        <li>Spell Thrust was dropped from the Items and <em>Spells vs. Spell Protections</em> fix as it was unnecessary</li>
        <li>Luck no longer stacks and now provides thieving and save bonuses</li>
        <li>The string fix for Teleport Field saves is actually correct now</li>
        <li><em>Immunities Don't Suppress All Effects</em> was adjusted to handle poison damage; specifically most disease damage is done through poison damage so an effort was made to provide disease immunity without also granting complete poison immunity. Charm immunity now suppresses the 'Dominated' string.</li>
        <li>Altered  the <em>Proper Kit Detection</em> fix to avoid conflicts with TobEX</li>
        <li>New spell scroll icons for <em>Items With Incorrect Icons</em> arenow taken directly from TotSC</li>
        <li>After an extensive review by Wisp, many more item weights and weapon speeds have been corrected</li>
        <li>The <em>Elhan's Elves Turning Hostile (And Not) Inappropriately</em> fix is altered to be closer to intended behavior</li>
        <li><em>Corrections to Item Usabilities</em> was allowing monks access to the mage scroll for Remove Curse</li>
        <li>The Chant and Grease fixes were misindexing the resulting files</li>
        <li>The Otiluke's Resilient Sphere Fixes was misindexing the spell</li>
        <li>Tightened up code for the Protection From Fire and Protection From Cold fixes to make it more robust</li>
        <li>The code to fix duplicate quest rewards from Garren Windspear has been made more robust</li>
        <li>The damage for the Potion of Fiery Burning really is fixed now</li>
        <li>While the range for Color Spray was increased, the projectile needed to be revised to actually reach 30 feet. The scroll is now left at its current (and now correct) range of 30 feet.</li>
        <li>The fix for Spook to suppress the Panic string on a magic-resistant target now works</li>
        <li>Defensive spin can no longer be undone by free action</li>
        <li>Added secondary types for a lot more items as part of the Spells vs. Spell Protections</li>
        <li>The cavalier's Resist Fear now really bypasses magic resistance</li>
        <li>Chromatic Orb was supposed to cause blindness at level one</li>
        <li>Torgal's revived form now has the same immunities as she did originally</li>
        <li>Patches for three EFF files as part of the <em>Common Spell Fix Roundup</em> were not working</li>
        <li>Damage for Holy Smite/Unholy Blight was incorrect</li>
        <li>At level one Protection from Evil wasn't making armor glow</li>
        <li>Adjusted some abilities for cursed scrolls (mainly portrait icons)</li>
        <li>Enemy-only summons retain their XP values</li>
        <li>More usability fixes for the Corthala Family Armor, Ankheg Plate, Red Dragon Scale, White Dragon Scale,  and Blue Dragon Plate</li>
        <li>After some review, it was determined that Neb is actually a gnome, not a dwarf, so this fix was reverted</li>
        <li>Rather han dumping spares into the override, we now remove corrupted items directly from the key</li>
        <li>Spellcasting via Rings of Air/Earth/Fire Control lacked the fixes applied to the underlying spells</li>
        <li>Adratha will no longer act surprised when you attack her when she's already hostile</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      minimalistic dialogue update which contains only the most relevant
      typographical corrections. The second option will install &quot;<acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> Classic&quot;

  <ul>
    <li>French and Italian translations updated.</li>
    <li>Basically-harmless typo in the Barbarian Rage code fixed</li>
    <li>&quot;Deutsche&quot; should apparently be &quot;Deutsch&quot;</li>
    <li>Updated to WEIDU v210</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 7 - December 29, 2008</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corrected Minor Globe of Invulnerability description is no longer pasted onto Know Alignment.</li>
    <li>Shriekers, Blue Myconids, and Carrion Crawlers were missing the
      resources giving them their proper sound sets; there were several errors
      with the chicken soundset also which are now correctly corrected. </li>
    <li>The game engine unfortunately will play at most two sound
      selections per category; our previous attempts to restore existing but
      unused sounds for a few monsters accomplished nothing and have been
      revoked. This is a Core Fix. </li>
    <li>An old bug in a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> patch was causing corrections to the game's
      climactic battle music to go haywire. This bug has been corrected; the
      battle theme now loops properly. </li>
    <li>In the Copper Coronet, a pair of trash talking louts were supposed
      to flee if any real violence took place, but their scripting was
      corrupt. We now correct an additional way in which their script may be
      broken. </li>
    <li>An earlier attempt to fix the broken usage of the &quot;Damage Versus
      Type&quot; opcode was having unforeseen consequences with other mods and was
      not being consistently applied; we now supply a new .eff file and apply
      it in every case. </li>
    <li>The casting time of innate Cure Light Wounds, Draw Upon Holy Might,
      and Horror were being altered to match the ordinary spells of the same
      names. In the absence of convincing developer intent, these fixes have
      been dropped. </li>
    <li>Aataqah's spelling error, Dermin's gender confusion, and Holy Word's incomplete description are corrected. </li>
    <li>Holy Smite wasn't correctly displaying the &quot;Blinded&quot; string (code by&nbsp;aVENGER)</li>
    <li>Small typo corrected in code for <em>chant doesn't provide the listed save bonuses nor the penalties to opponents. Also shouldn't stack.</em> (code by ScuD)</li>
    <li>The Mace of Disruption +2 is no longer being nerfed (code by aVENGER) </li>
    <li>A typo in an earlier correction to Barbarian Rage meant that fix wasn't working correctly; this is fixed. (code by Wisp)</li>
    <li><em>Halberd Flagged as Stolen</em> really is compatible with <em>More Than One Copy of Unique Items Can Be Obtained</em> now. (code by Wisp)</li>
    <li>The &quot;Harper's Call&quot; spell now correctly reduces Jaheira's ability
      scores (previously, due to a v6 typo, it was making them negative).
      (spotted by Mike1072, code by DavidW)</li>
    <li>Since the Grandmaster Armor is specifically described as not usable by monks, we revert to not making it usable. (code by Wisp)</li>
    <li>The <acronym title="Optional But Cool">OBC</acronym> component which gives Burning Hands an area effect was erroneously increasing its duration.</li>
    <li>Typo corrected in <acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> string @1048658</li>
    <li>German and Spanish translations updated</li>
    <li>The following fixes were added to <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Tolgerias vanishes repeatedly (spotted by Jastey, code by DavidW)</li>
        <li>Ployer can kill Jaheira (observed and originally coded by Icendoan, this code by DavidW)</li>
        <li>Dirbert is too picky about his swords (code by Icendoan, slightly tweaked by DavidW)</li>
        <li>Sword of Seeking does incorrect damage (code by Wisp)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 6 - January 31, 2008</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Incapacitated Solaufein Breaks Ust Natha Quests</em> in <strong>BETA
      Core Fixes</strong> had
      a nasty bug that actually broke this segment, hence the early and rapid
      appearance of v6 </li>
    <li>Rolled back<em> Horn of Kazgaroth Has Only One Charge
      if Imported</em> as it was
      unnecessary </li>
    <li>Adjusted code for <em>Fixed Bug That Prevents Saving
      Games (<acronym title="Operating System 10">OS X</acronym> Only)</em> fix
      so that it works better</li>
    <li>The left side of the bounding box for the fixed <em>Door
      in de'Arnise Keep is Offset From Actual Door</em> was off slightly and has been fixed </li>
    <li>Magical bullets were no longer being blocked by Protection from Normal
      Missiles in the <em>Protection From Normal Missiles Protecting
      Against Some Magical Missiles</em> fix, but they should still  be set to
      a different projectile </li>
    <li>Dropped two creatures from the <em>Gender Fixes</em></li>
    <li><em>Elhan's Elves Turning Hostile (And Not) Inappropriately</em> was overriding
      the wrong scripts </li>
    <li><em>Weapon Proficiencies Maximum and Minimum Fixes</em> was throttling paladins
      to two stars in dual-wielding</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 5 - January 28, 2008</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recoded several dialogue fixes to be nicer with other mods. Specifically,
      the <em>Slave Leader in Ust Natha 'No Valid Links' Dialogue Fix</em> and <em>Captain
      Arat Gives Infinite Fire Arrows</em> should resolve current issues </li>
    <li>Fixed two bugs with <em>Elven War Sages Sporadically Helping Party with
      Vampirism Cure</em> in <strong>BETA Core Fixes </strong></li>
    <li>Changed the handling of Telwyn in the <em>Pickpocket Exploits</em> fix</li>
    <li>Removed deva and planetar changes from the <em>Creature Gender Fixes</em> as
      this was effectively removing the celestial summoning cap </li>
    <li>Dropped the <em>Offhand Weapons Could Provide Unintended Bonuses to Main
      Hand Weapon and Vice-Versa</em> fix as it was not working as intended.
      This remains an outstanding issue for now </li>
    <li>New research showed that an opcode that provided damage bonuses against
      certain creature types was not fully working; this affects the Mace of
      Disruption, Daystar, and the Dragonslayer +2. The <em>Improved Mace of
      Disruption Fixes</em> was renamed to <em>Maces of Disruption Fixes</em> and
      expanded to address these new bugs found in the engine. New fixes for Daystar
      and Dragonslayer are introduced in the <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong> </li>
    <li>Cleaned up code in <em>Casting Spells from Scroll Fixes</em> (though
      this was not affecting anything) </li>
    <li>Fixed bug with <em>Immunities Don't Suppress All Effects</em> where it
      was still allowing portrait icons to be placed on Imoen while wearing her ber-belt
      in the opening dungeon </li>
    <li>Fixed unintended consequence of <em>Immunities Don't Suppress All Effects</em>,
      specifically with respect to poison. By making items and creatures fully
      immune to poison, we also made them immune to disease (which does poison
      damage). Only a handful of items were actually meant to convey immunity
      to both poison and disease, so the items affected by the patch have been
      scaled back. Also made sure that poison display strings were also suppressed. </li>
    <li>Fixed another unintended consequence of <em>Immunities Don't Suppress
      All Effects</em>, specifically with respect to web. This was making the
      Watcher's Keep statues immune to the effect that kept them frozen so,
      while they were inactive, they would still animate and sway in place </li>
    <li>Expanded <strong>Optional But Cool: Improved Spell Animations</strong> to
      include a nifty change for Burning Hands from Nythrun; the spell now is
      area of effect per its description instead of only affecting one target </li>
    <li>Fixed bug with <strong>Optional But Cool: Giants Receive Penalties When
      Attacking Halflings, Dwarves, and Gnomes</strong> where it was screwing
      up item indexes, causing issues for <acronym title="Operating System 10">OS X</acronym> players </li>
    <li><em>Several Errors With Familiars</em> was essentially rebuilt from the
      ground up </li>
    <li>Rolled back a few <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> creature patches in <em>Creatures With Items Not
      Equipped</em> as they were, at best, spurious and, at worst, interfering
      with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> games</li>
    <li>Expansion of the <em>Dispel/Remove Magic Generating Spurious Magic Resistance
      Message</em> review turned up similar errors in the existing <em>Staff
      of the Magi Errors</em> and <em>Carsomyr Issues</em> fixes </li>
    <li>Further tightened <em>Simulacrum Restoration Exploit</em></li>
    <li><em>Friends Fixes</em> was partially rolled back and <em>Comet Duration
      Fixes</em> was fully rolled back as the engine has problems with sometimes
      applying spell effects with staggered probabilities </li>
    <li>Touched up some <em>Immunities Don't Suppress All Effects</em> patches,
      specifically Free Action, to remove more leftover stun protection opcodes </li>
    <li>Expanded <strong>Optional But Cool: Additional Script Fixes</strong> to
      assign additional scripts to commoners so they would go hostile and run
      away if attacked by the party</li>
    <li><strong>Optional But Cool: Change Free Action to Protect Against Stun</strong> expanded
      to protect against additional complementary stun effects </li>
    <li>Renamed <em>Chosen of Cyric Weapon Not Displaying Portrait Icon or String</em> fix
      to <em>Weapon of Cyric's Favored Not Displaying Portrait Icon or String</em>,
      as they're really named Favored and not Chosen </li>
    <li>Reworked <em>Otiluke's Resilient Sphere Fixes</em>, as it was still far from complete</li>
    <li>Reworked <em>Option to Charm Glaicas Instead of Fight
      Fix</em> and <em>Troll Fixes</em> to remove incompatibilities with Unfinished Business </li>
    <li>Added <em>Spotty Golem Immunities</em> fix directly into <strong>Core
      Fixes</strong>, as it's essentially an adaptation of existing (and working
      code) </li>
    <li><em>Halberd Flagged as Stolen</em> was not accounting for the item change
      from <em>More Than One Copy of Unique Items Can Be Obtained</em> and was
      thus failing </li>
    <li>Miscellaneous changes and fixes to the <strong>Game Text Update</strong></li>
    <li>The following fixes were expanded/updated to fix more bugs:
      <ul>
        <li>Strings</li>
        <li>Draining Spells Healing Caster Even if Target Magic-Resistant </li>
        <li>Guards Summoned Well After Containers Are Burgled </li>
        <li>Creature Racial Fixes</li>
        <li>Creature Sex Fixes</li>
        <li>Creature Gender Fixes</li>
        <li>Dispel/Remove Magic Generating Spurious Magic Resistance Message </li>
        <li>Lavok Dies Too Quickly if Moved Outside </li>
        <li>Enchantment Level Errors</li>
        <li>Items Not Being Flagged as Magical </li>
        <li>Looping Music Fixes </li>
        <li>Anomen Banter Fixes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The following fixes were added to <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Anomen's Quests Break for Non-Romanceable Female <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>s</li>
        <li>Errors in Altercation Between Firkraag's Leiutenants</li>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 4 - July 4, 2007</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong> Paws from Shapeshifting Can Not Be Dispelled</strong> was causing
      crashes on some systems when encountering iron or adamantine golems; the
      component has been withdrawn until a new fix is implemented</li>
    <li>Dropped the <em>Nishruus and Hakeashars Eating Non-Magical Items</em> fix.
      In Throne of Bhaal, the opcodes responsible for this bug have been disabled
      with the official patch. In Shadows of Amn, the bug is unfixable. The component
      has been moved to the <strong>Super Happy Fun Lucky Modder Pack</strong> and
      renamed <em>Clean Up Leftover Default(0) Headers</em> as it does clean
      up a lot of extraneous junk from a number of item files. </li>
    <li>Dropped the <em>Yoshimo and Korgan Don't Recognize Gaelan's Changed Offer</em> fix
      from <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong>; after some discussion this was dropped
      over concerns this was a slippery slope fix and would be a gateway to dubious
      fixes </li>
    <li>Fixed bug in the core fixes that was preventing installation on <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>-only
      games</li>
    <li>Fixed bug with <em>Miscellaneous Script Resource Reference Fixes</em>;
      also updated documentation as some files were not listed as being modified </li>
    <li>Dropped the <em>Exploit to Keep Imported Items At Beginning of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym></em> fix,
      as it was generally causing more trouble with other mods than it was worth </li>
    <li>Added extra safeguard to prevent Brus spawning for the <em>Creatures
      Using Incorrect Script Names or Lacking Them Entirely</em> fix</li>
    <li><em>Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Spellbook
      Fixes</em> moved from the <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong> to the <strong>Core
      Fixes</strong> and was grouped with the <em>Edwin and Nalia Spell Slot
      Fixes</em>, <em>Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Spellbook
      Fixes</em>, and <em>Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> Have
      Empty Spellbooks</em> fixes into <em>Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Spellbook
      Errors</em> </li>
    <li><em>Improved Invisibility Fixes</em> was completely reworked as it was
      preventing legitimate re-casting of the spell. The new fix remains non-perfect
      but still a significant improvement over the patched game. </li>
    <li><em>Strength Spell Stacks Exceptional Strength</em> from <strong>BETA
      Core Fixes</strong> dropped as it was causing the spell to not act per
      its description; exploit is now fixed by adding Strength to the <em>Many
      Spells Should Not Be Able To Stack With Themselves</em> fix in <strong>Core
      Fixes</strong> </li>
    <li>The post-patch scripts in the <em>Player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> Scripting
      Errors</em> fix were tightened up</li>
    <li><em>Terrece Initiates Dialogue From Another Area</em> fix expanded and
      renamed <em>Terrece Spawn Errors </em></li>
    <li>Fix for the good deva in the <em>Devas Using Wrong Script, Spell Errors</em> was
      reworked; <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> itself
      has a bug here that was worked around</li>
    <li> Part of the <em>Killer Mimic Issues</em> fix in <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong> was
      redundant and was dropped </li>
    <li><em>Kensais Not Receiving Their Weapon Speed Bonuses</em> in the <strong>BETA
      Core Fixes</strong> expanded to include monks and renamed <em>Kensais
      and Monks Not Receiving Their Weapon Speed Bonuses </em></li>
    <li>Fixed nasty bug with the <em>Items and Spells Not Interacting Properly
      with Spell Immunities and Protections</em> fix (specifically spells)
      that was patching the wrong fields</li>
    <li>New <em>Casting Time Fixes</em> and <em>Arcane Magic School Fixes</em> combine
      and deprecate the following fixes: <em>Find Familiar Has Incorrect Casting
      Time</em>; <em>Nahal's Reckless Dweomer Has Incorrect Casting Time, Magic
      School</em>; <em>Protection From Acid Has Incorrect Casting Time</em>, <em>Shield
      Has Incorrect Magic School</em>, <em>Spell Casting Speed Fixes, Arcane
      Symbol Spells Have Incorrect Casting Speeds</em>, and <em>Arcane <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> Spells
      Should Be Schoolless</em>. These two also partially deprecate other fixes: <em>Grease
      Fixes</em>, <em>Armor Fixes</em>, <em>Hold Animal Errors</em>. Several
      spells have been added to both fixes. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug with <em>Deathblows Allowing Save</em> fix </li>
    <li>Miscellaneous changes and fixes to the <strong>Game Text Update</strong></li>
    <li>The following fixes were expanded/updated to fix more bugs:
      <ul>
        <li>Corrections to Item Usabilities</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The following fixes were added to <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong>:

  <p><strong>Version 3 - April 19, 2007</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added Italian translation (thanks Andrea C.)</li>
    <li>About 16 different fixes were consolidated (either partially or completely)
      into the new <em>Immunities Don't Suppress All Effects</em> fix, which
      streamlines and expands the fixes significantly </li>
    <li>Added dummy files to various components to allow for easy detection by
      other mods </li>
    <li>Added <em>Fixed Bug That Prevents Saving Games (<acronym title="Operating System 10">OS X</acronym> Only)</em> directly
      into the <strong>Core Fixes</strong>; it's a major bug but a very simple
      fix </li>
    <li><em>Creature Alignment Corrections</em> in the <strong>Core Fixes</strong> and
      Optional But Cool <strong>Additional Alignment Fixes</strong> were adjusted
      again, this time thanks to the help of David Gaider </li>
    <li>Fixed exploit with <em>Harper's Call Not Draining Stats</em> as it could
      be used to kill enemies via stat drain </li>

    <li>Changed behavior of <em>Many Scripts Not Checking the Correct Creatures/Objects</em> fix

  <p><strong>Version 2 - January 28, 2007</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added Korean translation (thanks web2air)</li>
    <li>The <em>Creature Alignment Corrections</em> fixes underwent extensive
      review, and many changes were made. After review, some of these fixes were
      moved into a new Optional But Cool component. </li>
    <li><em>Arbane's Sword Protecting From Extraneous Effects</em> was not removing
      Arbane's protection from web </li>
    <li>Fixed bug with <em>Chant Not Affecting Enemies</em> fix </li>
    <li>Tightened up matching pattern in <em>Exploit to Keep Imported Items At
      Beginning of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym></em> fix by
      request </li>
    <li><em>Rangers and Paladins Not Falling When Taking Evil Path in Hell Trials</em> was
      causing cleric-rangers to fall if the evil path was taken, but they do
      not fall anywhere else in the game </li>
    <li><em>Lavok Dies Too Quickly if Moved Outside</em> was tightened up with
      additional safeguards</li>

      a troll to disappear at the de'Arnise Keep instead of falling down </li>
    <li>Fixed bug with the changes to Melf's Minute Meteors as part of the <em>Blade
      Spin Fixes</em></li>
    <li>Corrected errors in <em>Friends Fixes</em> </li>

      the Improved Alacrity effect outright </li>
    <li><em>Stores Have Infinite Magical Items</em> was rolled back from restricting
      Ribald's Freedom scrolls--these are probably intentionally infinite as
      an anti-Kangaxx measure </li>
    <li><em>Grae the Troll Can Be Accidentally Killed</em> fix renamed to <em>Limited
      Wish Quest Fixes</em> and expanded with an additional fix to Vittorio's
      dialogue </li>
    <li><em>Many Dialogues Not Checking the Correct Creatures/Objects</em> was
      actually breaking the Saradush spellbook retrieval quest, as it was also
      matching and altering variable names instead of just script names </li>
    <li><em>Romance Scripting Fixes</em> was importing some spurious changes
      from the old Ease-of-Use mod which have been trimmed </li>
    <li><em>Bard Spell Memorization Table Fix</em> is an <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>-only
      fix but was being applied to <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> games</li>
    <li>Tightened up <em>Unseeing Eye <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> Exploit,
      Quest Breakage</em> again as more stuff that shouldn't be possible was
      happening </li>
    <li>Typos in new strings fixed</li>
    <li>Reworked <em>Stone Head in Shade Lord Dungeon Covers Container</em> into
      a more sensible fix</li>
    <li>Tightened up the <em>Weakening Bodhi Does Not Stop Her Regeneration</em> fix</li>
    <li>A few of the Five Flagons areas were dropped from the <em>Areas Types
      Flagged Incorrectly</em> fix as they apparently need to be flagged incorrectly
      as City for certain scripts to work. A long-term solution is in the works. </li>
    <li>Reviewed and corrected a few minor errors in <em>Corrections to Item
      Usabilities</em> </li>
    <li>Fixed bug with <em>Familiar Attacks Lack Icons</em> in the <strong>Beta
      Fixes </strong></li>

      Attacking Halflings, Dwarves, and Gnomes</strong> applying to the wrong
      creatures </li>
    <li>Miscellaneous Game Text Updates</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Added several common shoutids.ids entries</li>
      </ul>

  <p><strong>Version 1 - November 8, 2006</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>With the end of the beta series, a new component entitled <strong>BETA
      Core Fixes</strong> has been added. This component consists of fixes
      intended for Core Fixes, but have yet to be tested 'in the wild'. Fixes
      will eventually pass from this component to the Core Fixes component
      after they've been sufficiently tested</li>
    <li>Added new <acronym title="Optional But Cool">OBC</acronym> component <strong>Wizard Slayers Cause Miscast Magic on
      Ranged Attacks</strong></li>
    <li><em>Additional Entries for Spellcasting Scripts</em> fix has now been
      rolled into the <em>Add Throne of Bhaal Scripting Abilities to Shadows
      of Amn Games</em> </li>
    <li><em>Azuredge Axe Corrupted, Other Errors</em> fix has been redone to
      bring the axe more in line with developer intent </li>
    <li><em>Shadows of Amn Worldmap Fixes</em> was causing the Drizzt 'random
      encounter' to occur more than once when leaving the Underdark Exit area </li>
    <li><em>Delon Not Always Adding Umar Hills to the Map</em> fix expanded and
      renamed <em>Delon Fixes</em></li>
    <li>Corrected errors in the <em>Incorrect Party Orientation When Entering
      Areas</em> fix</li>
    <li>The <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> rabbit familiar was
      not getting its correct melee item in the <em>Several Errors With Familiars</em> fix </li>
    <li>Has no effect in game, but null string references are now referencing
      0xffffffff by request</li>
    <li>The Potion of Freedom had many more errors than originally thought, so
      the fix has been expanded to cover all of the new discoveries. The fix
      is renamed from the <em>Potion of Free Action Errors</em> to <em>Potion
      of Freedom Errors</em> to reflect the name in game. </li>
    <li>Updated <em>Staff of the Magi Errors</em> fix to address several effects
      that were subject to dispel magic and shouldn't be </li>
    <li>Revamped the <acronym title="Optional But Cool">OBC</acronym> Bard Song Fixes component</li>
    <li>When used with Melf's Minute Meteors, a blade's Offensive Spin could
      cause the attacks per round to drop to 0.5 due to an overflow issue in
      the engine. As a workaround, blades can no longer cast Offensive Spin when
      wielding Minute Meteors. </li>
    <li><em>Unseeing Eye <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> Exploit,
      Quest Breakage</em> now includes ar0701.bcs fixes. The issue addressed
      shouldn't even be possible, but was definitely occurring </li>
    <li>The <em>Corrupted Scripts</em> fix was not quite uncorrupting the scripts </li>
    <li>The <em>Hell Trial Exploits</em> fix was being too enthusiastic; the
      hold placed upon your party member in the Selfish trial couldn't even be
      dispelled by the Selfish Demon</li>
    <li>Added an extra safeguard to the <em>Solamnic Knights Multiple <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> Reward
      Exploit</em> fix as it was reported to be not working </li>
    <li>Due to typos, some of the interjections in the <em><acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> Do
      Not Comment on Watcher's Keep Events in the Shadows of Amn Portion of
      the Game</em> fix were referring to non-existent or mod-added string </li>
    <li>More spells were bypassing (Minor) Globes, so the <em>(Minor) Globe of
      Invulnerability Not Protecting Against Skull Trap</em> fix was expanded
      and renamed <em>(Minor) Globe of Invulnerability Fixes</em> </li>
    <li>Similar to issues with (Minor) Globe of Invulnerabilities, spell immunity
      items also needed explicit protections against certain spells. The <em>Rakshasa
      Not Immune to Area of Effect Spells</em> fix was rolled into this larger
      and more extensive fix entitled <em>Creatures With Incomplete Spell Immunities</em>. </li>
    <li>Miscellaneous Game Text Updates</li>
    <li>Improvements to the <strong>Super Happy Fun Lucky Modder Pack</strong> component:
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> proficiencies are no
          longer removed; the old long sword proficiency was providing a material
          (though probably unintended) benefit to creatures using weapons with
          a proficiency type of none (typically fists or innate attacks) </li>
        <li>Additional specifics.ids and shoutids.ids entries (also available
          as libraries) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

        <li>Carsomyr Issues</li>
        <li>Items Not Being Flagged as Magical </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The following fixes were added to <strong>BETA Core Fixes</strong>:

        <li>Amalas' Buddies Not Leaving Together</li>
        <li>Small Shields Erroneously Providing Protection Against Missiles </li>
        <li>Incorrect Damage for Oil of Fiery Burning</li>
        <li>Familiar Attacks Lack Icons </li>
        <li>Valygar's Departure in the Slums Can Cause Cut Scene Hang</li>
        <li>Soldier Barracks in the Docks Has Reversed Entry and Exit Points</li>
        <li>Unsellable Items </li>
        <li>Missing Reply Option in Svirfneblin Patrol Leader Dialogue</li>

        <li>Elgea Has Malformed Trigger</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
